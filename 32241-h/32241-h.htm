<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">To the Young Reader:</span></div>

<p>Charles Dickens was one of the greatest among
the many story-writers of "the Victorian age;"
that is, the middle and latter part of the Nineteenth
Century, when Victoria was Queen of
Great Britain. Perhaps he was the greatest of
them all for now, a generation after he passed
away, more people read the stories of Dickens
than those by any other author of that period.
In those wonderful writings are found many pictures
of child-life connected with the plan of the
novels or stories. These child-stories have been
taken out of their connections and are told by
themselves in this volume. By and by you will
read for yourselves, "The Christmas Carol,"
"The Chimes," "David Copperfield," "The Old
Curiosity Shop," and the other great books by
that fascinating writer, who saw people whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>nobody else ever saw, and made them real. When
you read those books you will meet again these
charming children, and will remember them as
the friends of your childhood.</p>

<h2>I.</h2>

<h3>TROTTY VECK AND HIS DAUGHTER MEG.</h3>


<div class='cap'>"TROTTY" seems a strange name for an
old man, but it was given to Toby
Veck because of his always going at
a trot to do his errands; for he was a ticket porter
or messenger and his office was to take letters and
messages for people who were in too great a hurry
to send them by post, which in those days was
neither so cheap nor so quick as it is now. He
did not earn very much, and had to be out in
all weathers and all day long. But Toby was of
a cheerful disposition, and looked on the bright
side of everything, and was grateful for any small
mercies that came in his way; and so was happier
than many people who never knew what it
is to be hungry or in want of comforts. His
greatest joy was his dear, bright, pretty daughter
Meg, who loved him dearly.</div>

<p>One cold day, near the end of the year, Toby had
been waiting a long time for a job, trotting up and
down in his usual place before the church, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
trying hard to keep himself warm, when the bells
chimed twelve o'clock, which made Toby think of
dinner.</p>

<p>"There's nothing," he remarked, carefully
feeling his nose to make sure it was still there,
"more regular in coming round than dinner-time,
and nothing less regular in coming round than dinner.
That's the great difference between 'em."
He went on talking to himself, trotting up and
down, and never noticing who was coming near
to him.</p>

<p>"Why, father, father," said a pleasant voice,
and Toby turned to find his daughter's sweet,
bright eyes close to his.</p>

<p>"Why, pet," said he, kissing her and squeezing
her blooming face between his hands, "what's
to-do? I didn't expect you to-day, Meg."</p>

<p>"Neither did I expect to come, father," said
Meg, nodding and smiling. "But here I am!
And not alone, not alone!"</p>

<p>"Why you don't mean to say," observed Trotty,
looking curiously at the covered basket she
carried, "that you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Smell it, father dear," said Meg. "Only
smell it!"</p>

<p>Trotty was going to lift up the cover at once,
in a great hurry, when she gaily interposed her hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no, no," said Meg, with the glee of a child.
"Lengthen it out a little. Let me just lift up the
corner; just a lit-tle, ti-ny cor-ner, you know,"
said Meg, suiting the action to the word with the
utmost gentleness, and speaking very softly, as
if she were afraid of being overheard by something
inside the basket. "There, now; what's
that?"</p>

<p>Toby took the shortest possible sniff at the edge
of the basket, and cried out in rapture:</p>

<p>"Why, it's hot," he said.</p>

<p>But to Meg's great delight he could not guess
what it was that smelt so good.</p>

<p>"Polonies? Trotters? Liver? Pigs' feet?
Sausages?" he tried one after the other. At last
he exclaimed in triumph. "Why, what am I
a-thinking of? It's tripe."</p>

<p>And it was.</p>

<p>"And so," said Meg, "I'll lay the cloth at once,
father; for I have brought the tripe in a basin, and
tied the basin up in a pocket-handkerchief; and
if I like to be proud for once, and spread that for
a cloth, and call it a cloth, there's nobody to prevent
me, is there father?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of, my dear," said Toby; "but
they're always a-bringing up some new law or
other."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"And according to what I was reading you in
the paper the other day, father, what the judge
said, you know, we poor people are supposed to
know them all. Ha, ha! What a mistake! My
goodness me, how clever they think us!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," cried Trotty; "and they'd be
very fond of any one of us that <i>did</i> know 'em all.
He'd grow fat upon the work he'd get, that man,
and be popular with the gentlefolks in his neighborhood.
Very much so!"</p>

<p>"He'd eat his dinner with an appetite, whoever
he was, if it smelt like this," said Meg cheerfully.
"Make haste, for there's a hot potato besides, and
half a pint of fresh-drawn beer in a bottle. Where
will you dine, father&mdash;on the post or on the steps?
Dear, dear, how grand we are! Two places to
choose from!"</p>

<p>"The steps to-day, my pet," said Trotty.
"Steps in dry weather, post in wet. There's
greater conveniency in the steps at all times,
because of the sitting down; but they're rheumatic
in the damp."</p>

<p>"Then, here," said Meg, clapping her hands
after a moment's bustle; "here it is all ready!
And beautiful it looks! Come, father. Come!"</p>



<p>And just as Toby was about to sit down to
his dinner on the door-steps of a big house close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
by, the chimes rang out again, and Toby took
off his hat and said, "Amen."</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus-022.jpg" width="500" height="328" alt="&quot;They Broke in Like a Grace, My Dear.&quot;  Page 13" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;They Broke in Like a Grace, My Dear.&quot;</span><br /><div class='pageref'><a href="#Page_13">Page 13</a></div>
</div>

<p>"Amen to the bells, father?"</p>

<p>"They broke in like a grace, my dear," said
Trotty; "they'd say a good one if they could, I'm
sure. Many's the kind thing they say to me.
How often have I heard them bells say, 'Toby
Veck, keep a good heart, Toby!' A million
times? More!"</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" cried Meg.</p>

<p>"When things is very bad, then it's 'Toby
Veck, Toby Veck, job coming soon, Toby!'"</p>

<p>"And it comes&mdash;at last, father," said Meg,
with a touch of sadness in her pleasant voice.</p>

<p>"Always," answered Toby. "Never fails."</p>

<p>While this discourse was holding, Trotty made
no pause in his attack upon the savory meat
before him, but cut and ate, and cut and drank,
and cut and chewed, and dodged about from tripe
to hot potato, and from hot potato back again to
tripe, with an unfailing relish. But happening
now to look all round the street&mdash;in case anybody
should be beckoning from any door or window for
a porter&mdash;his eyes, in coming back again, saw
Meg sitting opposite him, with her arms folded,
and only busy in watching his dinner with a smile
of happiness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Lord forgive me!" said Trotty, dropping
his knife and fork. "My dove! Meg! why didn't
you tell me what a beast I was?"</p>

<p>"Father!"</p>

<p>"Sitting here," said Trotty, in a sorrowful
manner, "cramming, and stuffing, and gorging
myself, and you before me there, never so much
as breaking your precious fast, nor wanting to,
when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I have broken it, father," interposed his
daughter, laughing, "all to bits. I have had my
dinner."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Trotty. "Two dinners in one
day! It ain't possible! You might as well tell
me that two New Year's days will come together,
or that I have had a gold head all my life, and
never changed it."</p>

<p>"I have had my dinner, father, for all that,"
said Meg, coming nearer to him. "And if you
will go on with yours, I'll tell you how and where,
and how your dinner came to be brought and&mdash;and
something else besides."</p>

<p>Toby still appeared not to believe her; but she
looked into his face with her clear eyes, and,
laying her hand upon his shoulder, motioned him
to go on while the meat was hot. So Trotty
took up his knife and fork again and went to work,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
but much more slowly than before, and shaking
his head, as if he were not at all pleased with
himself.</p>

<p>"I had my dinner, father," said Meg, after a
little hesitation, "with&mdash;with Richard. His
dinner-time was early; and as he brought his
dinner with him when he came to see me, we&mdash;we
had it together, father."</p>

<p>Trotty took a little beer and smacked his lips.
Then he said "Oh!" because she waited.</p>

<p>"And Richard says, father&mdash;" Meg resumed,
then stopped.</p>

<p>"What does Richard say, Meg?" asked Toby.</p>

<p>"Richard says, father&mdash;" Another stoppage.</p>

<p>"Richard's a long time saying it," said Toby.</p>

<p>"He says, then, father," Meg continued, lifting
up her eyes at last, and speaking in a tremble,
but quite plainly, "another year is nearly gone,
and where is the use of waiting on from year to
year, when it is so unlikely we shall ever be better
off than we are now? He says we are poor now,
father, and we shall be poor then; but we are
young now, and years will make us old before we
know it. He says that if we wait, people as poor
as we are, until we see our way quite clearly, the
way will be a narrow one indeed&mdash;the common
way&mdash;the grave, father."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>A bolder man than Trotty Veck must needs
have drawn upon his boldness largely to deny it.
Trotty held his peace.</p>

<p>"And how hard, father, to grow old and die,
and think we might have cheered and helped each
other! How hard in all our lives to love each
other, and to grieve, apart, to see each other
working, changing, growing old and gray. Even
if I got the better of it, and forgot him (which I
never could), oh, father, dear, how hard to have
a heart so full as mine is now, and live to have it
slowly drained out every drop, without remembering
one happy moment of a woman's life to stay
behind and comfort me and make me better!"</p>

<p>Trotty sat quite still. Meg dried her eyes,
and said more gaily&mdash;that is to say, with here a
laugh and there a sob, and here a laugh and sob
together:</p>

<p>"So Richard says, father, as his work was yesterday
made certain for some time to come, and
as I love him and have loved him full three years&mdash;ah,
longer than that, if he knew it!&mdash;will I
marry him on New Year's Day?"</p>

<p>Just then Richard himself came up to persuade
Toby to agree to their plan; and, almost at the
same moment, a footman came out of the house
and ordered them all off the steps, and some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
gentlemen came out who called up Trotty, and
asked a great many questions, and found a good
deal of fault, telling Richard he was very foolish
to want to get married, which made Toby feel
very unhappy, and Richard very angry. So the
lovers went off together sadly; Richard looking
gloomy and downcast, and Meg in tears. Toby,
who had a letter given him to carry, and a sixpence,
trotted off in rather low spirits to a very
grand house, where he was told to take the letter
in to the gentleman. While he was waiting, he
heard the letter read. It was from Alderman
Cute, to tell Sir Joseph Bowley that one of his
tenants named Will Fern, who had come to London
to try to get work, and been brought before
him charged with sleeping in a shed, and asking
if Sir Joseph wished him to be dealt kindly with
or otherwise. To Toby's great disappointment,
for Sir Joseph had talked a great deal about being
a friend to the poor, the answer was given that
Will Fern might be sent to prison as a vagabond,
and made an example of, though his only fault was
that he was poor. On his way home, Toby,
thinking sadly, with his hat pulled down low on
his head, ran against a man dressed like a country-man,
carrying a fair-haired little girl. Toby
enquired anxiously if he had hurt either of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
The man answered no, and seeing Toby had a kind
face, he asked him the way to Alderman Cute's
house.</p>

<p>"It's impossible," cried Toby, "that your name
is Will Fern?"</p>

<p>"That's my name," said the man.</p>

<p>Thereupon Toby told him what he had just
heard, and said, "Don't go there."</p>

<p>Poor Will told him how he could not make a
living in the country, and had come to London
with his orphan niece to try to find a friend of
her mother's and to endeavor to get some work,
and, wishing Toby a happy New Year, was about
to trudge wearily off again, when Trotty caught
his hand, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stay! The New Year never can be happy
to me if I see the child and you go wandering
away without a shelter for your heads. Come
home with me. I'm a poor man, living in a poor
place; but I can give you lodging for one night,
and never miss it. Come home with me! Here!
I'll take her!" cried Trotty, lifting up the child.
"A pretty one! I'd carry twenty times her weight
and never know I'd got it. Tell me if I go too quick
for you. I'm very fast. I always was!" Trotty
said this, taking about six of his trotting paces to
one stride of his tired companion, and with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
thin legs quivering again beneath the load he
bore.</p>

<p>"Why, she's as light," said Trotty, trotting in
his speech as well as in his gait&mdash;for he couldn't
bear to be thanked, and dreaded a moment's
pause&mdash;"as light as a feather. Lighter than a
peacock's feather&mdash;a great deal lighter. Here we
are and here we go!" And, rushing in, he set the
child down before his daughter. The little girl
gave one look at Meg's sweet face and ran into her
arms at once, while Trotty ran round the room,
saying, "Here we are and here we go. Here,
Uncle Will, come to the fire. Meg, my precious
darling, where's the kettle? Here it is and here
it goes, and it'll bile in no time!"</p>

<p>"Why, father!" said Meg, as she knelt before
the child and pulled off her wet shoes, "you're
crazy to-night, I think. I don't know what the
bells would say to that. Poor little feet, how cold
they are!"</p>

<p>"Oh, they're warmer now!" exclaimed the child.
"They're quite warm now!"</p>

<p>"No, no, no," said Meg. "We haven't rubbed
'em half enough. We're so busy. And when
they're done, we'll brush out the damp hair;
and when that's done, we'll bring some color to
the poor pale face with fresh water; and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that's done, we'll be so gay and brisk and
happy!"</p>

<p>The child, sobbing, clasped her round the neck,
saying, "O Meg, O dear Meg!"</p>

<p>"Good gracious me!" said Meg presently,
"father's crazy. He's put the dear child's bonnet
on the kettle, and hung the lid behind the door!"</p>

<p>Trotty hastily repaired this mistake, and went
off to find some tea and a rasher of bacon he
fancied "he had seen lying somewhere on the stairs."</p>

<p>He soon came back and made the tea, and
before long they were all enjoying the meal.
Trotty and Meg only took a morsel for form's
sake (for they had only a very little, not enough
for all), but their delight was in seeing their visitors
eat, and very happy they were&mdash;though
Trotty had noticed that Meg was sitting by the
fire in tears when they had come in, and he
feared her marriage had been broken off.</p>

<p>After tea Meg took Lilian to bed, and Toby
showed Will Fern where he was to sleep. As he
came back past Meg's door he heard the child
saying her prayers, remembering Meg's name and
asking for his. Then he went to sit by the fire
and read his paper, and fell asleep to have a
wonderful dream, so terrible and sad, that it was
a great relief when he woke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"And whatever you do, father," said Meg,
"don't eat tripe again without asking some
doctor whether it's likely to agree with you;
for how you <i>have</i> been going on! Good gracious!"</p>

<p>She was working with her needle at the little
table by the fire, dressing her simple gown with
ribbons for her wedding&mdash;so quietly happy, so
blooming and youthful, so full of beautiful promise
that he uttered a great cry as if it were an angel
in his house, then flew to clasp her in his arms.</p>

<p>But he caught his feet in the newspaper, which
had fallen on the hearth, and somebody came
rushing in between them.</p>

<p>"No!" cried the voice of this same somebody.
A generous and jolly voice it was! "Not even
you; not even you. The first kiss of Meg in
the New Year is mine&mdash;mine! I have been waiting
outside the house this hour to hear the bells
and claim it. Meg, my precious prize, a happy
year! A life of happy years, my darling wife!"</p>

<p>And Richard smothered her with kisses.</p>

<p>You never in all your life saw anything like
Trotty after this, I don't care where you have
lived or what you have seen; you never in your
life saw anything at all approaching him! He
kept running up to Meg, and squeezing her fresh
face between his hands and kissing it, going from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
her backwards not to lose sight of it, and running
up again like a figure in a magic lantern; and
whatever he did, he was constantly sitting himself
down in his chair, and never stopping in it for
one single moment, being&mdash;that's the truth&mdash;beside
himself with joy.</p>

<p>"And to-morrow's your wedding-day, my pet!"
cried Trotty. "Your real, happy wedding-day!"</p>

<p>"To-day!" cried Richard, shaking hands with
him. "To-day. The chimes are ringing in the
New Year. Hear them!"</p>

<p>They <i>were</i> ringing! Bless their sturdy hearts,
they <i>were</i> ringing! Great bells as they were&mdash;melodious,
deep-mouthed, noble bells, cast in no
common metal, made by no common founder&mdash;when
had they ever chimed like that before?</p>

<p>Trotty was backing off to that wonderful chair
again, when the child, who had been awakened
by the noise, came running in half-dressed.</p>

<p>"Why, here she is!" cried Trotty, catching her
up. "Here's little Lilian! Ha, ha, ha! Here
we are and here we go. Oh, here we are and here
we go again! And here we are and here we go!
And Uncle Will, too!"</p>

<p>Before Will Fern could make the least reply, a
band of music burst into the room, attended by a
flock of neighbors, screaming, "A Happy New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Year, Meg!" "A happy wedding!" "Many of 'em!"
and other fragmentary good-wishes of that sort.
The Drum (who was a private friend of Trotty's)
then stepped forward and said:</p>

<p>"Trotty Veck, my boy, it's got about that your
daughter is going to be married to-morrow.
There ain't a soul that knows you that don't
wish you well, or that knows her and don't wish
her well. Or that knows you both, and don't
wish you both all the happiness the New Year
can bring. And here we are to play it in and
dance it in accordingly."</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Chickenstalker came in (a good-humored,
nice-looking woman who, to the delight
of all, turned out to be the friend of Lilian's
mother, for whom Will Fern had come to look),
with a stone pitcher full of "flip," to wish Meg
joy, and then the music struck up, and Trotty,
making Meg and Richard second couple, led off
Mrs. Chickenstalker down the dance, and danced
it in a step unknown before or since, founded on
his own peculiar trot.</p>

<h2>II.</h2>

<h3>TINY TIM.</h3>


<div class='cap'>IT will surprise you all very much to hear that
there was once a man who did not like Christmas.
In fact, he had been heard on several
occasions to use the word <i>humbug</i> with regard to
it. His name was Scrooge, and he was a hard,
sour-tempered man of business, intent only on
saving and making money, and caring nothing for
anyone. He paid the poor, hard-working clerk
in his office as little as he could possibly get the
work done for, and lived on as little as possible
himself, alone, in two dismal rooms. He was
never merry or comfortable or happy, and he
hated other people to be so, and that was the reason
why he hated Christmas, because people <i>will</i>
be happy at Christmas, you know, if they possibly
can, and like to have a little money to
make themselves and others comfortable.</div>

<p>Well, it was Christmas eve, a very cold and
foggy one, and Mr. Scrooge, having given his poor
clerk permission very unwillingly to spend Christmas
day at home, locked up his office and went
home himself in a very bad temper, and with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
cold in his head. After having taken some gruel
as he sat over a miserable fire in his dismal room,
he got into bed, and had some wonderful and
disagreeable dreams, to which we will leave him,
whilst we see how Tiny Tim, the son of his poor
clerk, spent Christmas day.</p>

<p>The name of this clerk was Bob Cratchit. He
had a wife and five other children besides Tim,
who was a weak and delicate little cripple, and for
this reason was dearly loved by his father and the
rest of the family; not but what he was a dear
little boy, too, gentle and patient and loving,
with a sweet face of his own, which no one could
help looking at.</p>

<p>Whenever he could spare the time, it was Mr.
Cratchit's delight to carry his little boy out on his
shoulder to see the shops and the people; and to-day
he had taken him to church for the first time.</p>

<p>"Whatever has got your precious father and
your brother Tiny Tim!" exclaimed Mrs. Cratchit,
"here's dinner all ready to be dished up. I've
never known him so late on Christmas day before."</p>

<p>"Here he is, mother!" cried Belinda, and "here
he is!" cried the other children.</p>

<p>In came little Bob, the father, with at least
three feet of comforter, exclusive of the fringe,
hanging down before him; and his threadbare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
clothes darned up and brushed, to look just as
well as possible; and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder.
Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and
had his limbs supported by an iron frame!</p>

<p>"Why, where's our Martha?" cried Bob
Cratchit, looking round.</p>

<p>"Not coming," said Mrs. Cratchit.</p>

<p>"Not coming!" said Bob, with a sudden dropping
in his high spirits; for he had been Tim's
blood horse all the way from church, and had
come home rampant. "Not coming upon Christmas
day!"</p>

<p>Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if
it were only in joke; so she came out sooner than
had been agreed upon from behind the closet-door,
and ran into his arms, while the two young
Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into
the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding
singing in the copper kettle.</p>

<p>"And how did Tim behave?" asked Mrs.
Cratchit.</p>

<p>"As good as gold and better," replied his father.
"I think, wife, the child gets thoughtful, sitting at
home so much. He told me, coming home, that
he hoped the people in church who saw he was a
cripple, would be pleased to remember on Christmas
day who it was who made the lame to walk."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bless his sweet heart!" said the mother in a
trembling voice, and the father's voice trembled,
too, as he remarked that "Tiny Tim was growing
strong and hearty at last."</p>

<p>His active little crutch was heard upon the
floor, and back came Tiny Tim before another
word was spoken, led by his brother and sister to
his stool beside the fire; while Bob, Master Peter,
and the two young Cratchits (who seemed to be
everywhere at once) went to fetch the goose, with
which they soon returned in high procession.</p>

<p>Such a bustle ensued that you might have
thought a goose the rarest of all birds; a perfect
marvel, to which a black swan was a matter of
course&mdash;and in truth it was something very like it
in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy
(ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing
hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with
tremendous vigor; Miss Belinda sweetened up
the apple-sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates;
Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at
the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for
everybody, not forgetting themselves, and, mounting
guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into
their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose
before their turn came to be helped. At last the
dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit,
looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared
to plunge it in the breast; but when she did,
and when the long-expected gush of stuffing
issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all
round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by
the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with
the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!</p>

<p>There never was such a goose. Bob said he
didn't believe there ever was such a goose cooked.
Its tenderness and flavor, size, and cheapness
were the themes of universal admiration. Eked
out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes, it was
a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed,
as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying
one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they
hadn't ate it all at that! Yet everyone had had
enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular,
were steeped in sage and onions to the eyebrows!
But now, the plates being changed by Miss
Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone&mdash;too
nervous to bear witnesses&mdash;to take up the pudding
and bring it in.</p>

<p>Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose
it should break in turning out! Suppose
somebody should have got over the wall of the
back yard and stolen it, while they were merry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
with the goose&mdash;a supposition at which the two
young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of
horrors were supposed.</p>

<p>Halloo! A great deal of steam! The pudding
was out of the copper. A smell like a washing-day!
That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house
and a pastrycook's next door to each other,
with a laundress' next door to that! That was
the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit
entered&mdash;flushed, but smiling proudly&mdash;with the
pudding like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and
firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of lighted
brandy, and decorated with Christmas holly
stuck into the top.</p>

<p>Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said,
and calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest
success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their
marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the
weight was off her mind, she would confess she
had her doubts about the quantity of flour.
Everybody had something to say about it, but
nobody said or thought it was a small pudding for
a large family. It would have been really wicked
to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to
hint at such a thing.</p>

<p>At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was
cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
The hot stuff in the jug being tasted, and considered
perfect, apples and oranges were put upon
the table, and a shovel full of chestnuts on the
fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round
the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle,
meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow
stood the family display of glass. Two tumblers
and a custard cup without a handle.</p>

<p>These held the hot stuff from the jug, however,
as well as golden goblets would have done; and
Bob served it out with beaming looks, while the
chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked
noisily. Then Bob proposed:</p>

<p>"A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God
bless us!"</p>

<p>Which all the family re-echoed.</p>

<p>"God bless us everyone!" said Tiny Tim, the
last of all.</p>

<p>Now I told you that Mr. Scrooge had some
disagreeable and wonderful dreams on Christmas
eve, and so he had; and in one of them he dreamt
that a Christmas spirit showed him his clerk's
home; he saw them all gathered round the fire,
and heard them drink his health, and Tiny Tim's
song, and he took special note of Tiny Tim himself.</p>

<p>How Mr. Scrooge spent Christmas day we do not
know. He may have remained in bed, having a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
cold, but on Christmas night he had more dreams,
and in one of his dreams the spirit took him again
to his clerk's poor home. The mother was doing
some needlework, seated by the table, a tear
dropped on it now and then, and she said, poor
thing, that the work, which was black, hurt her
eyes. The children sat, sad and silent, about the
room, except Tiny Tim, who was not there.
Upstairs the father, with his face hidden in his
hands, sat beside a little bed, on which lay a
tiny figure, white and still. "My little child, my
pretty little child," he sobbed, as the tears fell
through his fingers on to the floor. "Tiny Tim
died because his father was too poor to give him
what was necessary to make him well; <i>you</i> kept
him poor;" said the dream-spirit to Mr. Scrooge.
The father kissed the cold, little face on the bed,
and went downstairs, where the sprays of holly
still remained about the humble room; and taking
his hat, went out, with a wistful glance at the
little crutch in the corner as he shut the door.
Mr. Scrooge saw all this, and many more things
as strange and sad, the spirit took care of that;
but, wonderful to relate, he woke the next morning
feeling a different man&mdash;feeling as he had
never felt in his life before. For after all, you
know that what he had seen was no more than a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
dream; he knew that Tiny Tim was not dead,
and Scrooge was resolved that Tiny Tim should
not die if he could help it.</p>

<p>"Why, I am as light as a feather, and as happy
as an angel, and as merry as a schoolboy," Scrooge
said to himself as he skipped into the next room
to breakfast and threw on all the coals at once,
and put two lumps of sugar in his tea. "I hope
everybody had a merry Christmas, and here's
a happy New Year to all the world."</p>

<p>On that morning, the day after Christmas poor
Bob Cratchit crept into the office a few minutes
late, expecting to be roundly abused and scolded
for it, but no such thing; his master was there
with his back to a good fire, and actually
smiling, and he shook hands with his clerk, telling
him heartily he was going to raise his salary and
asking quite affectionately after Tiny Tim!
"And mind you make up a good fire in your room
before you set to work, Bob," he said, as he closed
his own door.</p>

<p>Bob could hardly believe his eyes and ears, but
it was all true. Such doings as they had on New
Year's day had never been seen before in the
Cratchits' home, nor such a turkey as Mr. Scrooge
sent them for dinner. Tiny Tim had his share
too, for Tiny Tim did not die, not a bit of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Mr. Scrooge was a second father to him from that
day, he wanted for nothing, and grew up strong
and hearty. Mr. Scrooge loved him, and well he
might, for was it not Tiny Tim who had without
knowing it, through the Christmas dream-spirit,
touched his hard heart and caused him to become
a good and happy man?</p>

<h2>III.</h2>

<h3>THE RUNAWAY COUPLE.</h3>


<div class='cap'>THE Boots at the Holly Tree Inn was the
young man named Cobbs, who blacked
the shoes, and ran errands, and waited
on the people at the inn; and this is the story
that he told, one day.</div>

<p>"Supposing a young gentleman not eight years
old was to run away with a fine young woman of
seven, would you consider that a queer start?
That there is a start as I&mdash;the Boots at the Holly
Tree Inn&mdash;have seen with my own eyes; and I
cleaned the shoes they ran away in, and they
was so little that I couldn't get my hand into 'em.</p>

<p>"Master Harry Walmers' father, he lived at the
Elms, away by Shooter's Hill, six or seven miles
from London. He was uncommon proud of
Master Harry, as he was his only child; but he
didn't spoil him neither. He was a gentleman
that had a will of his own, and an eye of his own,
and that would be minded. Consequently,
though he made quite a companion of the fine
bright boy, still he kept the command over him,
and the child <i>was</i> a child. I was under-gardener<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
there at that time; and one morning Master
Harry, he comes to me and says&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Cobbs, how should you spell Norah, if you
was asked?' and then begun cutting it in print,
all over the fence.</p>

<p>"He couldn't say he had taken particular notice
of children before that; but really it was pretty
to see them two mites a-going about the place together,
deep in love. And the courage of the
boy! Bless your soul, he'd have throwed off his
little hat, and tucked up his little sleeves, and gone
in at a lion, he would, if they had happened to
meet one and she had been frightened of him.
One day he stops along, with her, where Boots
was hoeing weeds in the gravel, and says&mdash;speaking
up, 'Cobbs,' he says, 'I like you.' 'Do you, sir?
I'm proud to hear it.' 'Yes, I do, Cobbs. Why
do I like you, do you think, Cobbs?' 'Don't know,
Master Harry, I am sure.' 'Because Norah likes
you, Cobbs.' 'Indeed, sir? That's very gratifying.'
'Gratifying, Cobbs? It's better than millions
of the brightest diamonds to be liked by
Norah.' 'Certainly, sir.' 'You're going away,
ain't you, Cobbs?' 'Yes, sir.' 'Would you like
another situation, Cobbs?' 'Well, sir, I shouldn't
object, if it was a good 'un.' 'Then, Cobbs,'
says he, 'you shall be our head-gardener when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
we are married.' And he tucks her, in her little
sky-blue mantle, under his arm, and walks away.</p>

<p>"It was better than a picter, and equal to a
play, to see them babies with their long, bright,
curling hair, their sparkling eyes, and their
beautiful light tread, a-rambling about the garden,
deep in love. Boots was of opinion that the
birds believed they was birds, and kept up with
'em, singing to please 'em. Sometimes, they
would creep under the Tulip tree, and would sit
there with their arms round one another's necks,
and their soft cheeks touching, a-reading about
the prince and the dragon, and the good and bad
enchanters, and the king's fair daughter. Sometimes
he would hear them planning about having a
house in a forest, keeping bees and a cow, and
living entirely on milk and honey. Once he came
upon them by the pond, and heard Master Harry
say, 'Adorable Norah, kiss me, and say you love
me to distraction, or I'll jump in headforemost.'
And Boots made no question he would have done
it, if she hadn't done as he asked her.</p>

<p>"'Cobbs,' says Master Harry, one evening,
when Cobbs was watering the flowers, 'I am going
on a visit, this present mid-summer, to my grandmamma's
at York.'</p>

<p>"'Are you, indeed, sir? I hope you'll have a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
pleasant time. I am going into Yorkshire myself
when I leave here.'</p>

<p>"'Are you going to your grandmamma's,
Cobbs?'</p>

<p>"'No, sir. I haven't got such a thing.'</p>

<p>"'Not as a grandmamma, Cobbs?'</p>

<p>"'No, sir.'</p>

<p>"The boy looked on at the watering of the
flowers for a little while and then said, 'I shall be
very glad, indeed, to go, Cobbs&mdash;Norah's going.'</p>

<p>"'You'll be all right then, sir,' says Cobbs,
'with your beautiful sweetheart by your side.'</p>

<p>"'Cobbs,' returned the boy, flushing, 'I never
let anybody joke about it when I can prevent them.'</p>

<p>"'It wasn't a joke, sir,' says Cobbs, with
humility&mdash;'wasn't so meant.'</p>

<p>"'I am glad of that, Cobbs, because I like you!
you know, and you're going to live with us, Cobbs.</p>

<p>"'Sir.'</p>

<p>"'What do you think my grandmamma gives
me, when I go down there?'</p>

<p>"'I couldn't so much as make a guess, sir.'</p>

<p>"'A Bank of England five-pound note, Cobbs.'<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>"'Whew!' says Cobbs, 'that's a spanking sum
of money, Master Harry.'</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>"'A person could do a great deal with such a
sum of money as that. Couldn't a person, Cobbs?'</p>

<p>"'I believe you, sir!'</p>

<p>"'Cobbs,' said the boy, 'I'll tell you a secret.
At Norah's house they have been joking her about
me, and pretending to laugh at our being engaged.
Pretending to make game of it, Cobbs!'</p>

<p>"'Such, sir,' says Cobbs, 'is the wickedness of
human natur'.'</p>

<p>"The boy, looking exactly like his father, stood
for a few minutes with his glowing face towards the
sunset, and then departed with, 'Good night,
Cobbs. I'm going in.'</p>

<p>"I was the Boots at the Holly Tree Inn when
one summer afternoon the coach drives up, and
out of the coach gets these two children.</p>

<p>"The guard says to our governor, the inn-keeper,
'I don't quite make out these little passengers,
but the young gentleman's words was, that they
were to be brought here.' The young gentleman
gets out; hands his lady out; gives the driver
something for himself; says to our governor,
'We're to stop here to-night, please. Sitting-room
and two bedrooms will be required. Chops and
cherry-pudding for two!' and tucks her, in her
little sky-blue mantle, under his arm, and walks
into the house much bolder than brass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boots leaves me to judge what the amazement
of that establishment was when those two tiny
creatures, all alone by themselves, was marched
into the parlor&mdash;much more so when he, who had
seen them without their seeing him, gave the
governor his views of the errand they was upon.
'Cobbs,' says the governor, 'if this is so, I must
set off myself to York and quiet their friends'
minds. In which case you must keep your eye
upon 'em, and humor 'em, till I come back. But,
before I take these measures, Cobbs, I should wish
you to find out from themselves whether your
opinions is correct.' 'Sir, to you,' says Cobbs,
'that shall be done directly.'</p>

<p>"So Boots goes up stairs to the parlor, and there
he finds Master Harry on an enormous sofa
a-drying the eyes of Miss Norah with his pocket-hankecher.
Their little legs were entirely off the
ground of course, and it really is not possible for
Boots to express to me how small them children
looked.</p>

<p>"'It's Cobbs! It's Cobbs!' cries Master Harry,
and comes running to him, and catching hold of
his hand. Miss Norah comes running to him on
t'other side, and catching hold of his t'other hand,
and they both jump for joy.</p>

<p>"'I see you a-getting out, sir,' says Cobbs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
'I thought it was you. I thought I couldn't be
mistaken in your height and figure. What's the
object of your journey, sir? Are you going to be
married?'</p>

<p>"'We are going to be married, Cobbs, at Gretna
Green,' returned the boy. 'We have run away on
purpose. Norah has been in rather low spirits,
Cobbs; but she'll be happy, now we have found
you to be our friend.'</p>

<p>"'Thank you, sir, and thank <i>you</i>, miss,' says
Cobbs, 'for your good opinion. Did you bring any
luggage with you, sir?'</p>

<p>"If I will believe Boots when he gives me his
word and honor upon it, the lady had got a parasol,
a smelling-bottle, a round and a half of cold
buttered toast, eight peppermint drops, and a
hair-brush&mdash;seemingly a doll's. The gentleman
had got about half a dozen yards of string, a knife,
three or four sheets of writing-paper folded up
surprisingly small, an orange, and a china mug
with his name upon it.</p>

<p>"'What may be the exact natur' of your plans,
sir?' says Cobbs.</p>

<p>"'To go on,' replied the boy&mdash;which the
courage of that boy was something wonderful!&mdash;'in
the morning, and be married to-morrow.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Just so, sir,' says Cobbs. 'Would it meet
your views, sir, if I was to go with you?'</p>

<p>"When Cobbs said this, they both jumped for joy
again, and cried out, 'Oh, yes, yes, Cobbs! Yes!'</p>

<p>"'Well, sir,' says Cobbs. 'If you will excuse
my having the freedom to give an opinion, what
I should recommend would be this. I'm acquainted
with a pony, sir, which, put in a phaeton
that I could borrow, would take you and Mrs.
Harry Walmers, Jr. (myself driving, if you agree),
to the end of your journey in a very short space
of time. I am not altogether sure, sir, that this
pony will be at liberty to-morrow, but even if you
had to wait over to-morrow for him, it might be
worth your while. As to the small account for
your board here, sir, in case you was to find yourself
running at all short, that don't signify, because
I'm a part proprietor of this inn, and it could
stand over.'</p>

<p>"Boots tells me that when they clapped their
hands and jumped for joy again, and called him,
'Good Cobbs!' and 'Dear Cobbs!' and bent across
him to kiss one another in the delight of their
trusting hearts, he felt himself the meanest rascal
for deceiving 'em that ever was born.</p>

<p>"'Is there anything you want just at present,
sir?' says Cobbs, mortally ashamed of himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"'We would like some cakes after dinner,'
answered Master Harry, folding his arms, putting
out one leg, and looking straight at him, 'and two
apples&mdash;and jam. With dinner, we should like
to have toast and water. But Norah has always
been accustomed to half a glass of currant wine
at dessert. And so have I.'</p>

<p>"'It shall be ordered at the bar, sir,' says Cobbs,
and away he went.</p>

<p>"'The way in which the women of that house&mdash;without
exception&mdash;everyone of 'em&mdash;married
and single, took to that boy when they heard the
story, Boots considers surprising. It was as much
as he could do to keep 'em from dashing into the
room and kissing him. They climbed up all sorts
of places, at the risk of their lives, to look at him
through a pane of glass. They were seven deep
at the key-hole. They were out of their minds
about him and his bold spirit.</p>

<p>"In the evening Boots went into the room, to
see how the runaway couple was getting on. The
gentleman was on the window-seat, supporting
the lady in his arms. She had tears upon her
face, and was lying, very tired and half-asleep,
with her head upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>"'Mrs. Harry Walmers, Jr., tired, sir?' says Cobbs.</p>

<p>"'Yes, she is tired, Cobbs; but she is not used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to be away from home, and she has been in low
spirits again. Cobbs, do you think you could
bring a biffin, please?'</p>

<p>"'I ask your pardon, sir,' says Cobbs. 'What
was it you&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'I think a Norfolk biffin<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> would rouse her,
Cobbs. She is very fond of them.'</p>

<p>"Boots withdrew in search of the required
restorative, and, when he brought it in, the gentleman
handed it to the lady, and fed her with a
spoon, and took a little himself. The lady being
heavy with sleep, and rather cross. 'What should
you think, sir,' says Cobbs, 'of a chamber candlestick?'
The gentleman approved; the chambermaid
went first, up the great staircase; the lady,
in her sky-blue mantle, followed, gallantly led by
the gentleman; the gentleman kissed her at the
door, and retired to his own room, where Boots
softly locked him up.</p>

<p>"Boots couldn't but feel what a base deceiver
he was when they asked him at breakfast (they
had ordered sweet milk-and-water, and toast and
currant jelly, overnight) about the pony. It
really was as much as he could do, he don't mind
confessing to me, to look them two young things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in the face, and think how wicked he had grown
up to be. Howsomever, he went on a-lying like
a Trojan, about the pony. He told 'em it did so
unfortunately happen that the pony was half-clipped,
you see, and that he couldn't be taken out
in that state for fear that it should strike to his
inside. But that he'd be finished clipping in the
course of the day, and that to-morrow morning
at eight o'clock the phaeton would be ready.
Boots' view of the whole case, looking back upon
it in my room, is, that Mrs. Harry Walmers, Jr.,
was beginning to give in. She hadn't had her
hair curled when she went to bed, and she didn't
seem quite up to brushing it herself, and it's
getting in her eyes put her out. But nothing put
out Master Harry. He sat behind his breakfast
cup, a-tearing away at the jelly, as if he had been
his own father.</p>

<p>"After breakfast Boots is inclined to think that
they drawed soldiers&mdash;at least, he knows that
many such was found in the fireplace, all on horseback.
In the course of the morning Master Harry
rang the bell&mdash;it was surprising how that there
boy did carry on&mdash;and said in a sprightly way,
'Cobbs, is there any good walks in this neighborhood?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' says Cobbs. 'There's Love Lane.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Get out with you, Cobbs!'&mdash;that was that
there boy's expression&mdash;'you're joking.'</p>

<p>"'Begging your pardon, sir,' says Cobbs,
'there really is Love Lane. And a pleasant walk
it is, and proud I shall be to show it to yourself
and Mrs. Harry Walmers, Jr.'</p>

<p>"'Norah, dear,' said Master Harry, 'this is
curious. We really ought to see Love Lane. Put
on your bonnet, my sweetest darling, and we will
go there with Cobbs.'</p>

<p>"Boots leaves me to judge what a beast he felt
himself to be, when that young pair told him,
as they all three jogged along together, that they
had made up their minds to give him two thousand
guineas a year as head-gardener, on account of his
being so true a friend to 'em. Boots could have
wished at the moment that the earth would have
opened and swallowed him up; he felt so mean
with their beaming eyes a-looking at him, and
believing him. Well, sir, he turned the conversation
as well as he could, and he took 'em down
Love Lane to the water-meadows, and there
Master Harry would have drowned himself in half
a moment more, a-getting out a water-lily for
her&mdash;but nothing frightened that boy. Well,
sir, they was tired out. All being so new and
strange to 'em, they was tired as tired could be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
And they laid down on a bank of daisies, like the
children in the wood, leastways meadows, and fell
asleep.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, they woke up at last, and then one
thing was getting pretty clear to Boots, namely,
that Mrs. Harry Walmers', Jr., temper was on the
move. When Master Harry took her round the
waist she said he 'teased her so,' and when he says,
'Norah, my young May Moon, your Harry tease
you?' she tells him, 'Yes; and I want to go home!'</p>

<p>"However, Master Harry he kept up, and his
noble heart was as fond as ever. Mrs. Walmers
turned very sleepy about dusk and began to cry.
Therefore, Mrs. Walmers went off to bed as per
yesterday; and Master Harry ditto repeated.</p>

<p>"About eleven or twelve at night comes back
the inn-keeper in a chaise, along with Mr. Walmers
and an elderly lady. Mr. Walmers looks amused
and very serious, both at once, and says to our
missis, 'We are very much indebted to you, ma'am,
for your kind care of our little children, which we
can never sufficiently acknowledge. Pray, ma'am
where is my boy?' Our missis says, 'Cobbs has
the dear children in charge, sir. Cobbs, show
forty!' Then he says to Cobbs, 'Ah, Cobbs!
I am glad to see <i>you</i>. I understand you was here!'
And Cobbs says, 'Yes, sir. Your most obedient, sir.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"I may be surprised to hear Boots say it, perhaps,
but Boots assures me that his heart beat
like a hammer, going up-stairs. 'I beg your pardon,
sir,' says he, while unlocking the door; 'I
hope you are not angry with Master Harry. For
Master Harry is a fine boy, sir, and will do you
credit and honor.' And Boots signifies to me that
if the fine boy's father had contradicted him in
the daring state of mind in which he then was, he
thinks he should have 'fetched him a crack,' and
taken the consequences.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Walmers only says, 'No, Cobbs. No,
my good fellow. Thank you!' And the door
being open, goes in.</p>

<p>"Boots goes in too, holding the light, and he
sees Mr. Walmers go up to the bedside, bend gently
down, and kiss the little sleeping face. Then he
stands looking at it for a minute, looking wonderfully
like it; and then he gently shakes the little
shoulder.</p>

<p>"'Harry, my dear boy! Harry!'</p>

<p>"Master Harry starts up and looks at him.
Looks at Cobbs, too. Such is the honor of that
mite that he looks at Cobbs to see whether he has
brought him into trouble.</p>

<p>"'I am not angry, my child. I only want you
to dress yourself and come home.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Yes, pa.'</p>

<p>"Master Harry dresses himself quickly. His
breast begins to swell when he has nearly finished,
and it swells more and more as he stands a-looking
at his father; his father standing a-looking at him,
the quiet image of him.</p>

<p>"'Please may I'&mdash;the spirit of that little creatur',
and the way he kept his rising tears down!&mdash;'Please,
dear pa&mdash;may I&mdash;kiss Norah before I
go?'</p>

<p>"'You may, my child.'</p>

<p>"So he takes Master Harry in his hand, and
Boots leads the way with the candle, and they
come to that other bedroom; where the elderly
lady is seated by the bed, and poor little Mrs.
Harry Walmers, Jr., is fast asleep. There the
father lifts the child up to the pillow, and he lays
his little face down for an instant by the little
warm face of poor unconscious little Mrs. Harry
Walmers, Jr., and gently draws it to him&mdash;a sight
so touching to the chambermaids who are peeping
through the door that one of them calls out,
'It's a shame to part 'em!' But this chambermaid
was always, as Boots informs me, a soft-hearted
one. Not that there was any harm in that girl.
Far from it."</p>

<h2>IV.</h2>

<h3>LITTLE DORRIT.</h3>


<div class='cap'>MANY years ago, when people could be put
in prison for debt, a poor gentleman, who
was unfortunate enough to lose all his
money, was brought to the Marshalsea prison,
which was the prison where debtors were kept. As
there seemed no prospect of being able to pay his
debts, his wife and their two little children came
to live there with him. The elder child was a
boy of three; the younger a little girl of two years
old, and not long afterwards another little girl
was born. The three children played in the courtyard,
and on the whole were happy, for they were
too young to remember a happier state of things.</div>

<p>But the youngest child, who had never been outside
the prison walls, was a thoughtful little creature,
and wondered what the outside world could be like.
Her great friend, the turnkey, who was also her godfather,
became very fond of her, and as soon as she
could walk and talk he brought a little arm-chair
and stood it by his fire at the lodge, and coaxed her
with cheap toys to come and sit with him. In return
the child loved him dearly, and would often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
bring her doll to dress and undress as she sat in the
little arm-chair. She was still a very tiny creature
when she began to understand that everyone did
not live locked up inside high walls with spikes at
the top, and though she and the rest of the family
might pass through the door that the great key
opened, her father could not; and she would look at
him with a wondering pity in her tender little heart.</p>

<p>One day, she was sitting in the lodge gazing
wistfully up at the sky through the barred window.
The turnkey, after watching her some time, said:</p>

<p>"Thinking of the fields, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Where are they?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why, they're&mdash;over there, my dear," said the
turnkey, waving his key vaguely, "just about
there."</p>

<p>"Does anybody open them and shut them?
Are they locked?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the turnkey, not knowing what to
say, "not in general."</p>

<p>"Are they pretty, Bob?" She called him Bob,
because he wished it.</p>

<p>"Lovely. Full of flowers. There's buttercups,
and there's daisies, and there's&mdash;" here he hesitated
not knowing the names of many flowers&mdash;"there's
dandelions, and all manner of games."</p>

<p>"Is it very pleasant to be there, Bob?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Prime," said the turnkey.</p>

<p>"Was father ever there?"</p>

<p>"Hem!" coughed the turnkey. "O yes, he was
there, sometimes."</p>

<p>"Is he sorry not to be there now?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;not particular," said the turnkey.</p>

<p>"Nor any of the people?" she asked, glancing
at the listless crowd within. "O are you quite
sure and certain, Bob?"</p>

<p>At this point, Bob gave in and changed the subject
to candy. But after this chat, the turnkey
and little Amy would go out on his free Sunday
afternoons to some meadows or green lanes, and
she would pick grass and flowers to bring home,
while he smoked his pipe; and then they would
go to some tea-gardens for shrimps and tea and
other delicacies, and would come back hand in
hand, unless she was very tired and had fallen
asleep on his shoulder.</p>

<p>When Amy was only eight years old, her mother
died; and the poor father was more helpless and
broken-down than ever, and as Fanny was a
careless child and Edward idle, the little one, who
had the bravest and truest heart, was led by her
love and unselfishness to be the little mother of
the forlorn family, and struggled to get some little
education for herself and her brother and sister.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>At first, such a baby could do little more than
sit with her father, deserting her livelier place by
the high fender, and quietly watching him. But
this made her so far necessary to him that he
became accustomed to her, and began to be
sensible of missing her when she was not there.
Through this little gate, she passed out of her
childhood into the care-laden world.</p>

<p>What her pitiful look saw, at that early time,
in her father, in her sister, in her brother, in the
jail; how much or how little of the wretched truth
it pleased God to make plain to her, lies hidden
with many mysteries. It is enough that she was
inspired to be something which was not what the
rest were, and to be that something, different and
laborious, for the sake of the rest. Inspired?
Yes. Shall we speak of a poet or a priest, and not
of the heart impelled by love and self-devotion
to the lowliest work in the lowliest way of life?</p>

<p>The family stayed so long in the prison that the
old man came to be known as "The Father of the
Marshalsea;" and little Amy, who had never
known any other home, as "The Child of the
Marshalsea."</p>

<p>At thirteen she could read and keep accounts&mdash;that
is, could put down in words and figures how
much the bare necessaries that they wanted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
would cost, and how much less they had to buy
them with. She had been, by snatches of a few
weeks at a time, to an evening school outside,
and got her sister and brother sent to day-schools
from time to time during three or four years.
There was no teaching for any of them at home;
but she knew well&mdash;no one better&mdash;that a man so
broken as to be the Father of the Marshalsea,
could be no father to his own children.</p>

<p>To these scanty means of improvement, she
added another of her own contriving. Once among
the crowd of prisoners there appeared a dancing-master.
Her sister had a great desire to learn the
dancing-master's art, and seemed to have a taste
that way. At thirteen years old, the Child of the
Marshalsea presented herself to the dancing-master,
with a little bag in her hand, and offered
her humble petition.</p>

<p>"If you please, I was born here, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! you are the young lady, are you?" said
the dancing-master, surveying the small figure
and uplifted face.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And what can I do for you?" said the dancing-master.</p>

<p>"Nothing for me, sir, thank you," anxiously
undrawing the strings of the little bag; "but if,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
while you stay here, you could be so kind as to
teach my sister cheap&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My child, I'll teach her for nothing," said the
dancing-master, shutting up the bag. He was
as good-natured a dancing-master as ever danced
to the Insolvent Court, and he kept his word.
The sister was so apt a pupil, and the dancing-master
had such abundant time to give her, that
wonderful progress was made. Indeed, the dancing-master
was so proud of it, and so wishful to
show it before he left, to a few select friends
among the collegians (the debtors in the prison
were called "collegians"), that at six o'clock on a
certain fine morning, an exhibition was held in
the yard&mdash;the college-rooms being of too small
size for the purpose&mdash;in which so much ground was
covered, and the steps were so well executed, that
the dancing-master, having to play his fiddle
besides, was thoroughly tired out.</p>

<p>The success of this beginning, which led to the
dancing-master's continuing his teaching after
his release, led the poor child to try again. She
watched and waited months for a seamstress.
In the fullness of time a milliner came in, sent
there like all the rest for a debt which she could
not pay; and to her she went to ask a favor for
herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, ma'am," she said, looking
timidly round the door of the milliner, whom she
found in tears and in bed: "but I was born here."</p>

<p>Everybody seemed to hear of her as soon as
they arrived; for the milliner sat up in bed, drying
her eyes, and said, just as the dancing-master
had said:</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>you</i> are the child, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"I am sorry I haven't got anything for you,"
said the milliner, shaking her head.</p>

<p>"It's not that, ma'am. If you please, I want
to learn needlework."</p>

<p>"Why should you do that," returned the
milliner, "with me before you? It has not done
me much good."</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;seems to have done
anybody much good who comes here," she
returned in her simple way; "but I want to learn,
just the same."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are so weak, you see," the
milliner objected.</p>

<p>"I don't think I am weak, ma'am."</p>

<p>"And you are so very, very little, you see," the
milliner objected.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am afraid I am very little indeed,"
returned the Child of the Marshalsea; and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
began to sob over that unfortunate smallness of
hers, which came so often in her way. The milliner&mdash;who
was not unkind or hardhearted, only
badly in debt&mdash;was touched, took her in hand
with good-will, found her the most patient and
earnest of pupils, and made her a good workwoman.</p>

<p>In course of time, the Father of the Marshalsea
gradually developed a new trait of character. He
was very greatly ashamed of having his two
daughters work for their living; and tried to
make it appear that they were only doing work
for pleasure, not for pay. But at the same time
he would take money from any one who would
give it to him, without any sense of shame. With
the same hand that had pocketed a fellow-prisoner's
half-crown half an hour ago, he would
wipe away the tears that streamed over his cheeks
if anything was spoken of his daughters' earning
their bread. So, over and above her other daily
cares, the Child of the Marshalsea had always upon
her the care of keeping up the make-believe that
they were all idle beggars together.</p>

<p>The sister became a dancer. There was a
ruined uncle in the family group&mdash;ruined by his
brother, the Father of the Marshalsea, and knowing
no more how, than his ruiner did, but taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the fact as something that could not be helped.
Naturally a retired and simple man, he had shown
no particular sense of being ruined, at the time
when that calamity fell upon him, further than
he left off washing himself when the shock was
announced, and never took to washing his face
and hands any more. He had been a rather poor
musician in his better days; and when he fell with
his brother, supported himself in a poor way by
playing a clarionet as dirty as himself in a small
theatre band. It was the theatre in which his
niece became a dancer; he had been a fixture
there a long time when she took her poor station
in it; and he accepted the task of serving as her
guardian, just as he would have accepted an
illness, a legacy, a feast, starvation&mdash;anything
but soap.</p>

<p>To enable this girl to earn her few weekly
shillings, it was necessary for the Child of the
Marshalsea to go through a careful form with her
father.</p>

<p>"Fanny is not going to live with us, just now,
father. She will be here a good deal in the day,
but she is going to live outside with uncle."</p>

<p>"You surprise me. Why?"</p>

<p>"I think uncle wants a companion, father.
He should be attended to and looked after."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"A companion? He passes much of his time
here. And you attend and look after him, Amy,
a great deal more than ever your sister will. You
all go out so much; you all go out so much."</p>

<p>This was to keep up the form and pretense of
his having no idea that Amy herself went out by
the day to work.</p>

<p>"But we are always very glad to come home
father; now, are we not? And as to Fanny,
perhaps besides keeping uncle company and
taking care of him, it may be as well for her not
quite to live here always. She was not born here
as I was you know, father."</p>

<p>"Well, Amy, well. I don't quite follow you,
but it's natural I suppose that Fanny should
prefer to be outside, and even that you often
should, too. So, you and Fanny and your uncle,
my dear, shall have your own way. Good, good.
I'll not meddle; don't mind me."</p>

<p>To get her brother out of the prison; out of the
low work of running errands for the prisoners
outside, and out of the bad company into which
he had fallen, was her hardest task. At eighteen
years of age her brother Edward would have
dragged on from hand to mouth, from hour to
hour, from penny to penny, until eighty. Nobody
got into the prison from whom he gained anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
useful or good, and she could find no patron for
him but her old friend and godfather, the turnkey.</p>

<p>"Dear Bob," said she, "what is to become of
poor Tip?" His name was Edward, and Ted had
been changed into Tip, within the walls.</p>

<p>The turnkey had strong opinions of his own as
to what would become of poor Tip, and had even
gone so far with the view of preventing their fulfilment,
as to talk to Tip in urging him to run
away and serve his country as a soldier. But Tip
had thanked him, and said he didn't seem to care
for his country.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear," said the turnkey, "something
ought to be done with him. Suppose I try and
get him into the law?"</p>

<p>"That would be so good of you, Bob!"</p>

<p>The turnkey now began to speak to the lawyers
as they passed in and out of the prison. He spoke
so perseveringly that a stool and twelve shillings
a week were at last found for Tip in the office of
a lawyer at Clifford's Inn, in the Palace Court.</p>

<p>Tip idled in Clifford's Inn for six months, and
at the end of that term sauntered back one
evening with his hands in his pockets, and
remarked to his sister that he was not going back
again.</p>

<p>"Not going back again?" said the poor little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
anxious Child of the Marshalsea, always calculating
and planning for Tip, in the front rank of her
charges.</p>

<p>"I am so tired of it," said Tip, "that I have
cut it."</p>

<p>Tip tired of everything. With intervals of
Marshalsea lounging, and errand-running, his
small second mother, aided by her trusty friend,
got him into a warehouse, into a market garden,
into the hop trade, into the law again, into an
auctioneer's, into a brewery, into a stockbroker's,
into the law again, into a coach office, into a wagon
office, into the law again, into a general dealer's,
into a distillery, into the law again, into a wool
house, into a dry goods house, into the fish-market,
into the foreign fruit trade, and into the
docks. But whatever Tip went into he came out
of tired, announcing that he had cut it. Wherever
he went, this useless Tip appeared to take the
prison walls with him, and to set them up in such
trade or calling; and to prowl about within their
narrow limits in the old slipshod, purposeless,
down-at-heel way; until the real immovable
Marshalsea walls asserted their power over him
and brought him back.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the brave little creature did so
fix her heart on her brother's rescue that, while he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was ringing out these doleful changes, she pinched
and scraped enough together to ship him for Canada.
When he was tired of nothing to do, and disposed
in its turn to cut even that, he graciously consented
to go to Canada. And there was grief in
her bosom over parting with him, and joy in the
hope of his being put in a straight course at last.</p>

<p>"God bless you, dear Tip. Don't be too proud
to come and see us, when you have made your
fortune."</p>

<p>"All right!" said Tip, and went.</p>

<p>But not all the way to Canada; in fact, not
further than Liverpool. After making the voyage
to that port from London, he found himself so
strongly impelled to cut the vessel, that he resolved
to walk back again. Carrying out which
intention, he presented himself before her at the
expiration of a month, in rags, without shoes, and
much more tired than ever.</p>

<p>At length, after another period of running
errands, he found a pursuit for himself, and
announced it.</p>

<p>"Amy, I have got a situation."</p>

<p>"Have you really and truly, Tip?"</p>

<p>"All right. I shall do now. You needn't look
anxious about me any more, old girl."</p>

<p>"What is it, Tip?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, you know Slingo by sight?"</p>

<p>"Not the man they call the dealer?"</p>

<p>"That's the chap. He'll be out on Monday,
and he's going to give me a berth."</p>

<p>"What is he a dealer in, Tip?"</p>

<p>"Horses. All right! I shall do now, Amy."</p>

<p>She lost sight of him for months afterwards,
and only heard from him once. A whisper passed
among the elder prisoners that he had been seen
at a mock auction in Moorfields, pretending to
buy plated articles for real silver, and paying for
them with the greatest liberality in bank-notes;
but it never reached her ears. One evening she
was alone at work&mdash;standing up at the window,
to save the twilight lingering above the wall&mdash;when
he opened the door and walked in.</p>

<p>She kissed and welcomed him; but was afraid
to ask him any question. He saw how anxious
and timid she was, and appeared sorry.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, Amy, you'll be vexed this time.
Upon my life I am!"</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to hear you say so, Tip.
Have you come back?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Not expecting this time that what you had
found would answer very well, I am less surprised
and sorry than I might have been, Tip."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! But that's not the worst of it."</p>

<p>"Not the worst of it?"</p>

<p>"Don't look so startled. No, Amy, not the
worst of it. I have come back, you see; but&mdash;<i>don't</i>
look so startled&mdash;I have come back in what
I may call a new way. I am off the volunteer list
altogether. I am in now, as one of the regulars.
I'm here in prison for debt, like everybody else."</p>

<p>"Oh! Don't say that you are a prisoner, Tip!
Don't, don't!"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want to say it," he returned in
unwilling tone; "but if you can't understand me
without my saying it, what am I to do? I am in
for forty pound odd."</p>

<p>For the first time in all those years, she sunk
under her cares. She cried, with her clasped
hands lifted above her head, that it would kill
their father if he ever knew it; and fell down at
Tip's worthless feet.</p>

<p>It was easier for Tip to bring her to her senses
than for her to bring <i>him</i> to understand that the
Father of the Marshalsea would be beside himself
if he knew the truth. Tip thought that there was
nothing strange in being there a prisoner, but he
agreed that his father should not be told about it.
There were plenty of reasons that could be given
for his return; it was accounted for to the father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in the usual way; and the collegians, with a
better understanding of the kind fraud than Tip,
stood by it faithfully.</p>

<p>This was the life, and this the history, of the
Child of the Marshalsea, at twenty-two. With a
still abiding interest in the one miserable yard and
block of houses as her birthplace and home, she
passed to and fro in it shrinking now, with a
womanly consciousness that she was pointed out to
everyone. Since she had begun to work beyond
the walls, she had found it necessary to hide where
she lived, and to come and go secretly as she
could, between the free city and the iron gates,
outside of which she had never slept in her life.
Her original timidity had grown with this concealment,
and her light step and her little figure
shunned the thronged streets while they passed
along them.</p>

<p>Worldly wise in hard and poor necessities, she
was innocent in all things else. Innocent, in the
mist through which she saw her father, and the
prison, and the dark living river that flowed
through it and flowed on.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;Mr. Clennam Followed Her Home.&quot;</span><br />   <div class='pageref'><a href="#Page_65">Page 65</a></div>
</div>

<p>This was the life, and this the history, of
Little Dorrit, until the son of a lady, Mrs. Clennam,
to whose house Amy went to do needlework,
became interested in the pale, patient little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
creature. He followed her to her home one day
and when he found that it was the debtor's prison,
he walked in. Learning her sad history from
her father, Arthur Clennam resolved to do his best
to try to get him released and to help them all.</p>

<p>One day when he was walking home with Amy
to try to find out the names of some of the people
her father owed money to, a voice was heard
calling, "Little mother, little mother," and a
strange figure came bouncing up to them and fell
down, scattering her basketful of potatoes on the
ground. "Oh Maggie," said Amy, "what a clumsy
child you are!"</p>

<p>She was about eight and twenty, with large
bones, large features, large hands and feet, large
eyes, and no hair. Amy told Mr. Clennam that
Maggie was the granddaughter of her old nurse,
who had been dead a long time, and that her grandmother
had been very unkind to her and beat her.</p>

<p>"When Maggie was ten years old she had a fever,
and she has never grown older since."</p>

<p>"Ten years old," said Maggie. "But what a
nice hospital! So comfortable, wasn't it? Such
a 'e'v'nly place! Such beds there is there! Such
lemonades! Such oranges! Such delicious broth
and wine! Such chicking! Oh, <span class="smcap">ain't</span> it a delightful
place to stop at!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor Maggie thought that a hospital was the
nicest place in all the world, because she had
never seen another home as good. For years and
years she looked back to the hospital as a sort of
heaven on earth."</p>

<p>"Then when she came out, her grandmother
did not know what to do with her, and was very
unkind. But after some time Maggie tried to
improve, and was very attentive and industrious
and now she can earn her own living entirely,
sir!"</p>

<p>Amy did not say who had taken pains to teach
and encourage the poor half-witted creature, but
Mr. Clennam guessed from the name "little
mother" and the fondness of the poor creature for
Amy.</p>

<p>One cold, wet evening, Amy and Maggie went
to Mr. Clennam's house to thank him for having
freed Edward from the prison, and on coming
out found it was too late to get home, as the gate
was locked. They tried to get in at Maggie's
lodgings, but, though they knocked twice, the
people were asleep. As Amy did not wish to
disturb them, they wandered about all night,
sometimes sitting at the gate of the prison, Maggie
shivering and whimpering.</p>

<p>"It will soon be over, dear," said patient Amy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it's all very well for you, mother," said
Maggie, "but I'm a poor thing, only ten years old."</p>

<p>Thanks to Mr. Clennam, a great change took
place in the fortunes of the family, and not long
after this wretched night it was discovered that
Mr. Dorrit was owner of a large property, and they
became very rich.</p>

<p>But Little Dorrit never forgot, as, sad to say,
the rest of the family did, the friends who had been
kind to them in their poverty; and when, in his
turn, Mr. Clennam became a prisoner in the Marshalsea,
Little Dorrit came to comfort and console
him, and after many changes of fortune she
became his wife, and they lived happy ever after.</p>

<h2>V.</h2>

<h3>THE TOY-MAKER AND HIS BLIND DAUGHTER.</h3>


<div class='cap'>CALEB PLUMMER and his blind daughter
lived alone in a little cracked nutshell of a
house. They were toy-makers, and their
house, which was so small that it might have
been knocked to pieces with a hammer, and carried
away in a cart, was stuck like a toadstool on
to the premises of Messrs. Gruff &amp; Tackleton,
the toy merchants for whom they worked&mdash;the
latter of whom was himself both Gruff and
Tackleton in one.</div>

<p>I am saying that Caleb and his blind daughter
lived here. I should say Caleb did, while his
daughter lived in an enchanted palace, which her
father's love had created for her. She did not
know that the ceilings were cracked, the plaster
tumbling down, and the woodwork rotten; that
everything was old and ugly and poverty-stricken
about her, and that her father was a gray-haired,
stooping old man, and the master for whom they
worked a hard and brutal taskmaster; oh, dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
no, she fancied a pretty, cosy, compact little
home full of tokens of a kind master's care, a
smart, brisk, gallant-looking father, and a handsome
and noble-looking toy merchant who was
an angel of goodness.</p>

<p>This was all Caleb's doing. When his blind
daughter was a baby he had determined, in his
great love and pity for her, that her loss of sight
should be turned into a blessing, and her life as
happy as he could make it. And she was happy;
everything about her she saw with her father's
eyes, in the rainbow-colored light with which it
was his care and pleasure to invest it.</p>

<p>Caleb and his daughter were at work together
in their usual working-room, which served them
for their ordinary living-room as well; and a
strange place it was. There were houses in it,
finished and unfinished, for dolls of all stations
in life. Tenement houses for dolls of moderate
means; kitchens and single apartments for dolls
of the lower classes; capital town residences for
dolls of high estate. Some of these establishments
were already furnished with a view to the
needs of dolls of little money; others could be
fitted on the most expensive scale, at a moment's
notice, from whole shelves of chairs and tables,
sofas, bedsteads, and upholstery. The nobility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and gentry and public in general, for whose use
these doll-houses were planned, lay, here and
there, in baskets, staring straight up at the ceiling;
but in showing their degrees in society, and
keeping them in their own stations (which is
found to be exceedingly difficult in real life), the
makers of these dolls had far improved on nature,
for they, not resting on such marks as satin,
cotton-print, and bits of rag, had made differences
which allowed of no mistake. Thus, the doll-lady
of high rank had wax limbs of perfect shape; but
only she and those of her grade; the next grade
in the social scale being made of leather; and the
next coarse linen stuff. As to the common-people,
they had just so many matches out of tinder-boxes
for their arms and legs, and there they were&mdash;established
in their place at once, beyond the
possibility of getting out of it.</p>

<p>There were various other samples of his handicraft
besides dolls in Caleb Plummer's room.
There were Noah's Arks, in which the birds and
beasts were an uncommonly tight fit, I assure
you; though they could be crammed in, anyhow,
at the roof, and rattled and shaken into the
smallest compass. Most of these Noah's Arks
had knockers on the doors; perhaps not exactly
suitable to an Ark as suggestive of morning callers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and a postman, yet a pleasant finish to the outside
of the building. There were scores of melancholy
little carts, which, when the wheels went round,
performed most doleful music. Many small
fiddles, drums, and other instruments of torture;
no end of cannon, shields, swords, spears, and
guns. There were little tumblers in red breeches,
incessantly swarming up high obstacles of red-tape,
and coming down, head first, upon the
other side; and there were innumerable old
gentlemen of respectable, even venerable, appearance,
flying like crazy people over pegs,
inserted, for the purpose, in their own street-doors.
There were beasts of all sorts, horses, in
particular, of every breed, from the spotted
barrel on four pegs, with a small tippet for a
mane, to the fine rocking horse on his highest
mettle.</p>

<p>"You were out in the rain last night in your
beautiful new overcoat," said Bertha.</p>

<p>"Yes, in my beautiful new overcoat," answered
Caleb, glancing to where a roughly-made garment
of sackcloth was hung up to dry.</p>

<p>"How glad I am you bought it, father."</p>

<p>"And of such a tailor! quite a fashionable
tailor; a bright blue cloth, with bright buttons;
it's a deal too good a coat for me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Too good!" cried the blind girl, stopping to
laugh and clap her hands&mdash;"as if anything was
too good for my handsome father, with his
smiling face, and black hair, and his straight
figure, as if <i>any</i> thing could be too good for my
handsome father!"</p>

<p>"I'm half ashamed to wear it, though," said
Caleb, watching the effect of what he said upon
her brightening face; "upon my word. When I
hear the boys and people say behind me: 'Halloa!
Here's a swell!' I don't know which way to look.
And when the beggar wouldn't go away last
night; and, when I said I was a very common
man, said 'No, your honor! Bless your honor,
don't say that!' I was quite ashamed. I really
felt as if I hadn't a right to wear it."</p>

<p>Happy blind girl! How merry she was in her
joy!</p>

<p>"I see you, father," she said, clasping her hands,
"as plainly as if I had the eyes I never want when
you are with me. A blue coat!"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bright blue," said Caleb.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! Bright blue!" exclaimed the girl,
turning up her radiant face; "the color I can just
remember in the blessed sky! You told me it
was blue before! A bright blue coat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Made loose to the figure," suggested Caleb.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes! loose to the figure!" cried the blind girl,
laughing heartily; "and in it you, dear father,
with your merry eye, your smiling face, your free
step, and your dark hair; looking so young and
handsome!"</p>

<p>"Halloa! Halloa!" said Caleb. "I shall be
vain presently."</p>

<p>"I think you are already," cried the blind girl,
pointing at him, in her glee. "I know you,
father! Ha, ha, ha! I've found you out, you
see!"</p>

<p>How different the picture in her mind from
Caleb, as he sat observing her! She had spoken
of his free step. She was right in that. For years
and years he never once had crossed that threshold
at his own slow pace, but with a footfall made
ready for her ear, and never had he, when his
heart was heaviest, forgotten the light tread that
was to render hers so cheerful and courageous.</p>

<p>"There we are," said Caleb, falling back a pace
or two to form the better judgment of his work;
"as near the real thing as sixpen'orth of halfpence
is to sixpence. What a pity that the whole front
of the house opens at once! If there was only a
staircase in it now, and regular doors to the rooms
to go in at! but that's the worst of my calling.
I'm always fooling myself, and cheating myself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are speaking quite softly. You are not
tired, father?"</p>

<p>"Tired," echoed Caleb, with a great burst in
his manner, "what should tire me, Bertha?
<i>I</i> was never tired. What does it mean?"</p>

<p>To give the greater force to his words, he
stopped himself in an imitation of two small
stretching and yawning figures on the mantel-shelf,
who were shown as in one eternal state of weariness
from the waist upwards; and hummed a bit of a
song. It was a drinking song, something about
a sparkling bowl; and he sang it with an air of a
devil-may-care voice, that made his face a
thousand times more meager and more thoughtful
than ever.</p>

<p>"What! you're singing, are you?" said Tackleton,
the toy-seller for whom he worked, putting
his head in at the door. "Go it! <i>I</i> can't
sing."</p>

<p>Nobody would have thought that Tackleton
<i>could</i> sing. He hadn't what is generally termed
a singing face, by any means.</p>

<p>"I can't afford to sing," said Tackleton. "I'm
glad you can. I hope you can afford to work, too.
Hardly time for both, I should think?"</p>

<p>"If you could only see him, Bertha, how he's
winking at me!" whispered Caleb. "Such a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to joke! you'd think, if you didn't know him, he
was in earnest, wouldn't you, now?"</p>

<p>The blind girl smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>"I am thanking you for the little tree, the
beautiful little tree," replied Bertha, bringing
forward a tiny rose-tree in blossom, which, by an
innocent story, Caleb had made her believe was
her master's gift, though he himself had gone
without a meal or two to buy it.</p>

<p>"The bird that can sing and won't sing must
be made to sing, they say," grumbled Tackleton.
"What about the owl that can't sing, and oughtn't
to sing, and will sing; is there anything that he
should be made to do?"</p>

<p>"The extent to which he's winking at this
moment!" whispered Caleb to his daughter. "Oh,
my gracious!"</p>

<p>"Always merry and light-hearted with us!"
cried the smiling Bertha.</p>

<p>"Oh! you're there, are you?" answered Tackleton.
"Poor idiot!"</p>

<p>He really did believe she was an idiot; and he
founded the belief, I can't say whether consciously
or not, upon her being fond of him.</p>

<p>"Well! and being there&mdash;how are you?" said
Tackleton, in his cross way.</p>

<p>"Oh! well; quite well. And as happy as even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
you can wish me to be. As happy as you would
make the whole world, if you could!"</p>

<p>"Poor idiot!" muttered Tackleton. "No gleam
of reason! Not a gleam!"</p>

<p>The blind girl took his hand and kissed it; held
it for a moment in her own two hands; and laid
her cheek against it tenderly, before releasing it.
There was such unspeakable affection and such
fervent gratitude in the act, that Tackleton himself
was moved to say, in a milder growl than
usual:</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?"</p>

<p>"Bertha!" said Tackleton, assuming, for once,
a little cordiality. "Come here."</p>

<p>"Oh! I can come straight to you. You needn't
guide me," she rejoined.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you a secret, Bertha?"</p>

<p>"If you will!" she answered, eagerly.</p>

<p>How bright the darkened face! How adorned
with light the listening head!</p>

<p>"This is the day on which little what's-her-name,
the spoilt child, Peerybingle's wife, pays
her regular visit to you&mdash;makes her ridiculous
picnic here; ain't it?" said Tackleton, with a
strong expression of distaste for the whole
concern.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Bertha. "This is the day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thought so!" said Tackleton. "I should like
to join the party."</p>

<p>"Do you hear that, father!" cried the blind
girl in delight.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I hear it," murmured Caleb, with the
fixed look of a sleep-walker "but I do not believe
it. It's one of my lies, I've no doubt."</p>

<p>"You see I&mdash;I want to bring the Peerybingles
a little more into company with May Fielding,"
said Tackleton. "I am going to be married to
May."</p>

<p>"Married!" cried the blind girl, starting from
him.</p>

<p>"She's such a confounded idiot," muttered
Tackleton, "that I was afraid she'd never understand
me. Yes, Bertha! Married! Church, parson,
clerk, glass-coach, bells, breakfast, bride-cake,
favors, marrow-bones, cleavers, and all the
rest of the tomfoolery. A wedding, you know;
a wedding. Don't you know what a wedding is?"</p>

<p>"I know," replied the blind girl, in a gentle tone.
"I understand!"</p>

<p>"Do you?" muttered Tackleton. "It's more
than I expected. Well, on that account I want
you to join the party, and to bring May and her
mother. I'll send a little something or other,
before the afternoon. A cold leg of mutton, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
some comfortable trifle of that sort. You'll
expect me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

<p>She had drooped her head, and turned away;
and so stood, with her hands crossed, musing.</p>

<p>"I don't think you will," muttered Tackleton,
looking at her; "for you seem to have forgotten
all about it already. Caleb!"</p>

<p>"I may venture to say, I'm here, I suppose,"
thought Caleb. "Sir!"</p>

<p>"Take care she don't forget what I've been
saying to her."</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> never forgets," returned Caleb. "It's
one of the few things she ain't clever in."</p>

<p>"Every man thinks his own geese swans,"
observed the toy merchant, with a shrug. "Poor
devil!"</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of which remark with
infinite contempt, old Gruff &amp; Tackleton withdrew.</p>

<p>Bertha remained where he had left her, lost in
meditation. The gaiety had vanished from her
downcast face, and it was very sad. Three or
four times she shook her head, as if bewailing
some remembrance or some loss; but her sorrowful
reflections found no vent in words.</p>

<p>"Father, I am lonely in the dark. I want my
eyes; my patient, willing eyes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here they are," said Caleb. "Always ready.
They are more yours than mine, Bertha, any hour
in the four-and-twenty. What shall your eyes
do for you, dear?"</p>

<p>"Look round the room, father."</p>

<p>"All right," said Caleb. "No sooner said than
done, Bertha."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"It's much the same as usual," said Caleb.
"Homely, but very snug. The gay colors on the
walls; the bright flowers on the plates and dishes;
the shining wood, where there are beams or panels;
the general cheerfulness and neatness of the building,
make it very pretty."</p>

<p>Cheerful and neat it was, wherever Bertha's
hands could busy themselves. But nowhere else
were cheerfulness and neatness possible, in the
crazy shed which Caleb's fancy so transformed.</p>

<p>"You have your working dress on, and are not
so gay as when you wear the handsome coat?"
said Bertha, touching him.</p>

<p>"Not quite so gay," answered Caleb. "Pretty
brisk though."</p>

<p>"Father," said the blind girl, drawing close to
his side and stealing one arm round his neck,
"tell me something about May. She is very fair."</p>

<p>"She is, indeed," said Caleb. And she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
indeed. It was quite a rare thing to Caleb not to
have to draw on his invention.</p>

<p>"Her hair is dark," said Bertha, pensively,
"darker than mine. Her voice is sweet and
musical I know. I have often loved to hear it.
Her shape&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's not a doll's in all the room to equal it,"
said Caleb. "And her eyes&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped; for Bertha had drawn closer round
his neck; and, from the arm that clung about
him, came a warning pressure which he understood
too well.</p>

<p>He coughed a moment, hammered for a moment,
and then fell back upon the song about the sparkling
bowl; the song which helped him through
all such difficulties.</p>

<p>"Our friend, father; the one who has helped us
so many times, Mr. Tackleton. I am never tired
you know, of hearing about him. Now was I,
ever?" she said, hastily.</p>

<p>"Of course not," answered Caleb. "And with
reason."</p>

<p>"Ah! with how much reason?" cried the blind
girl, with such fervency that Caleb, though his
motives were pure, could not endure to meet her
face, but dropped his eyes, as if she could have
read in them his innocent deceit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then tell me again about him, dear father,"
said Bertha. "Many times again! His face is
good, kind, and tender. Honest and true, I am
sure it is. The manly heart that tries to cloak
all favors with a show of roughness and unwillingness
beats in its every look and glance."</p>

<p>"And makes it noble," added Caleb in his quiet
desperation.</p>

<p>"And makes it noble!" cried the blind girl.
"He is older than May, father?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es," said Caleb, reluctantly. "He's a
little older than May, but that don't signify."</p>

<p>"Bertha," said Caleb softly, "what has happened?
How changed you are, my darling, in a
few hours&mdash;since this morning. <i>You</i> silent and
dull all day! What is it? Tell me!"</p>

<p>"Oh father, father!" cried the blind girl, bursting
into tears. "Oh, my hard, hard fate!"</p>

<p>Caleb drew his hand across his eyes before he
answered her.</p>

<p>"But think how cheerful and how happy you
have been, Bertha! How good, and how much
loved, by many people."</p>

<p>"That strikes me to the heart, dear father!
Always so mindful of me! Always so kind to me!"</p>

<p>Caleb was very much perplexed to understand
her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"To be&mdash;to be blind, Bertha, my poor dear,"
he faltered, "is a great affliction; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have never felt it!" cried the blind girl.
"I have never felt it in its fullness. Never! I
have sometimes wished that I could see you, or
could see him; only once, dear father; only for
one little minute. But, father! Oh, my good,
gentle father, bear with me, if I am wicked!" said
the blind girl. "This is not the sorrow that so
weighs me down!"</p>

<p>"Bertha, my dear!" said Caleb, "I have something
on my mind I want to tell you, while we are
alone. Hear me kindly! I have a confession to
make to you, my darling."</p>

<p>"A confession, father?"</p>

<p>"I have wandered from the truth and lost
myself, my child," said Caleb, with a pitiable look
on his bewildered face. "I have wandered from
the truth, intending to be kind to you; and have
been cruel."</p>

<p>She turned her wonder-stricken face towards
him, and repeated, "Cruel! He cruel to me!"
cried Bertha, with a smile of incredulity.</p>

<p>"Not meaning it, my child," said Caleb. "But
I have been; though I never suspected it till
yesterday. My dear blind daughter, hear me and
forgive me! The world you live in, heart of mine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
doesn't exist as I have represented it. The eyes
you have trusted in have been false to you."</p>

<p>She turned her wonder-stricken face towards
him still.</p>

<p>"Your road in life was rough, my poor one," said
Caleb, "and I meant to smooth it for you. I have
altered objects, invented many things that never
have been, to make you happier. I have had
concealments from you, put deceptions on you,
God forgive me! and surrounded you with fancies."</p>

<p>"But living people are not fancies?" she said
hurriedly, and turning very pale, and still retiring
from him. "You can't change them."</p>

<p>"I have done so, Bertha," pleaded Caleb.
"There is one person that you know, my Dove&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, father! why do you say I know?" she
answered in a tone of keen reproach. "What and
whom do I know! I, who have no leader! I, so
miserably blind!"</p>

<p>In the anguish of her heart she stretched out
her hands, as if she were groping her way; then
spread them, in a manner most forlorn and sad,
upon her face.</p>

<p>"The marriage that takes place to-day," said
Caleb, "is with a stern, sordid, grinding man.
A hard master to you and me, my dear, for many
years. Ugly in his looks and in his nature. Cold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and callous always. Unlike what I have painted
him to you in everything, my child. In everything."</p>

<p>"Oh, why," cried the blind girl, tortured, as it
seemed, almost beyond endurance, "why did you
ever do this? Why did you ever fill my heart so
full, and then come in, like death, and tear away
the objects of my love? Oh, heaven, how blind
I am! How helpless and alone!"</p>

<p>Her afflicted father hung his head, and offered
no reply but in his grief.</p>

<p>"Tell me what my home is. What it truly is."</p>

<p>"It is a poor place, Bertha; very poor and bare
indeed. The house will scarcely keep out wind
and rain another winter. It is as roughly shielded
from the weather, Bertha, as your poor father in
his sackcloth coat."</p>

<p>"Those presents that I took such care of, that
came almost at my wish, and were so dearly welcome
to me," she said, trembling; "where did they
come from?"</p>

<p>Caleb did not answer. She knew already, and
was silent.</p>

<p>"I see, I understand," said Bertha, "and now
I am looking at you, at my kind, loving compassionate
father, tell me what is he like?"</p>

<p>"An old man, my child; thin, bent, gray-haired,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
worn-out with hard work and sorrow; a weak,
foolish, deceitful old man."</p>

<p>The blind girl threw herself on her knees before
him, and took his gray head in her arms. "It is
my sight, it is my sight restored," she cried.
"I have been blind, but now I see; I have never
till now truly seen my father. Does he think that
there is a gay, handsome father in this earth that
I could love so dearly, cherish so devotedly, as
this worn and gray-headed old man? Father
there is not a gray hair on your head that shall be
forgotten in my prayers and thanks to heaven."</p>

<p>"My Bertha!" sobbed Caleb, "and the brisk
smart father in the blue coat&mdash;he's gone, my
child."</p>

<p>"Dearest father, no, he's not gone, nothing is
gone, everything I loved and believed in is here in
this worn, old father of mine, and more&mdash;oh, so
much more, too! I have been happy and contented,
but I shall be happier and more contented
still, now that I know what you are. I am <i>not</i>
blind, father, any longer."</p>

<h3>LITTLE NELL.</h3>


<div class="figright" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/illus-099.jpg" width="319" height="500" alt="Little Nell and Her Grandfather.   Page 86" title="" />
<span class="caption">Little Nell and Her Grandfather.</span>  <div class='pageref'><a href="#Page_86"> Page 86</a></div>
</div>
<div class='cap'>THE house where little Nell and her grandfather
lived was one of those places where
old and curious things were kept, one of
those old houses which seem to crouch in odd
corners of the town, and to hide their musty
treasures from the public eye in jealousy and
distrust. There were suits of mail standing like
ghosts in armor, here and there; curious carvings
brought from monkish cloisters; rusty
weapons of various kinds; distorted figures in
china, and wood, and iron, and ivory; tapestry,
and strange furniture that might have been designed
in dreams; and in the old, dark, dismal
rooms there lived alone together the man and a
child&mdash;his grandchild, Little Nell. Solitary and
dull as was her life, the innocent and cheerful
spirit of the child found happiness in all things,
and through the dim rooms of the old curiosity
shop Little Nell went singing, moving with gay
and lightsome step.</div>


<p>But gradually over the old man, whom she so
tenderly loved, there stole a sad change. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
became thoughtful, sad and wretched. He had
no sleep or rest but that which he took by day in
his easy-chair; for every night, and all night long,
he was away from home. To the child it seemed
that her grandfather's love for her increased, even
with the hidden grief by which she saw him struck
down. And to see him sorrowful, and not to
know the cause of his sorrow; to see him growing
pale and weak under his trouble of mind, so
weighed upon her gentle spirit that at times she
felt as though her heart must break.</p>

<p>At last the time came when the old man's
feeble frame could bear up no longer against his
hidden care. A raging fever seized him, and, as
he lay delirious or insensible through many weeks,
Nell learned that the house which sheltered them
was theirs no longer; that in the future they would
be very poor; that they would scarcely have
bread to eat. At length the old man began to
mend, but his mind was weakened.</p>

<p>He would sit for hours together, with Nell's
small hand in his, playing with the fingers, and
sometimes stopping to smooth her hair or kiss
her brow; and when he saw that tears were glistening
in her eyes he would look amazed. As the
time drew near when they must leave the house,
he made no reference to the necessity of finding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
other shelter. An indistinct idea he had that the
child was desolate and in need of help; though he
seemed unable to understand their real position
more distinctly. But a change came upon him
one evening, as he and Nell sat silently together.</p>

<p>"Let us speak softly, Nell," he said. "Hush!
for if they knew our purpose they would say that
I was mad, and take thee from me. We will not
stop here another day. We will travel afoot
through the fields and woods, and trust ourselves
to God in the places where He dwells. To-morrow
morning, dear, we'll turn our faces from this scene
of sorrow, and be as free and happy as the birds."</p>

<p>The child's heart beat high with hope and confidence.
She had no thought of hunger, or cold,
or thirst, or suffering. To her it seemed that they
might beg their way from door to door in happiness,
so that they were together.</p>

<p>When the day began to glimmer they stole out
of the house, and, passing into the street, stood
still.</p>

<p>"Which way?" asked the child.</p>

<p>The old man looked doubtfully and helplessly
at her, and shook his head. It was plain that she
was thenceforth his guide and leader. The child
felt it, but had no doubts or misgivings, and,
putting her hand in his, led him gently away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Forth from the city, while it yet was asleep went
the two poor wanderers, going, they knew not
whither.</p>

<p>They passed through the long, deserted streets,
in the glad light of early morning, until these
streets dwindled away, and the open country was
about them. They walked all day, and slept
that night at a small cottage where beds were let
to travelers. The sun was setting on the second
day of their journey, and they were jaded and
worn out with walking, when, following a path
which led through a churchyard to the town where
they were to spend the night, they fell in with two
traveling showmen, the exhibitors or keepers
of a Punch and Judy show. These two men
raised their eyes when the old man and his young
companion were close upon them. One of them,
the real exhibitor, no doubt, was a little, merry-faced
man with a twinkling eye and a red nose,
who seemed to be something like old Punch himself.
The other&mdash;that was he who took the
money&mdash;had rather a careful and cautious look,
which perhaps came from his business also.</p>

<p>The merry man was the first to greet the
strangers with a nod; and following the old man's
eyes, he observed that perhaps that was the first
time he had ever seen a Punch off the stage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you come here to do this?" said the
old man sitting down beside them, and looking at
the figures with extreme delight.</p>

<p>"Why, you see," rejoined the little man, "we're
putting up for to-night at the public house yonder,
and it wouldn't do to let 'em see the present company
undergoing repair."</p>

<p>"No!" cried the old man, making signs to Nell
to listen, "why not, eh? why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it would destroy all the reality of the
show and take away all the interest, wouldn't it?"
replied the little man. "Would you care a
ha'penny for the Lord Chancellor if you know'd
him in private and without his wig?&mdash;certainly
not."<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>"Good!" said the old man, venturing to touch
one of the puppets, and drawing away his hand
with a shrill laugh. "Are you going to show 'em
to-night? are you?"</p>

<p>"That is the purpose, governor," replied the
other, "and unless I'm much mistaken, Tommy
Codlin is a-calculating at this minute what we've
lost through your coming upon us. Cheer up,
Tommy, it can't be much."</p>

<p>The little man accompanied these latter words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
with a wink, expressive of the estimate he had
formed of the travelers' pocketbook.</p>

<p>To this Mr. Codlin, who had a surly, grumbling
manner, replied, as he twitched Punch off the
tombstone and flung him into the box:</p>

<p>"I don't care if we haven't lost a farden, but
you're too free. If you stood in front of the
curtain and see the public's faces as I do, you'd
know human natur' better."</p>

<p>Turning over the figures in the box like one who
knew and despised them, Mr. Codlin drew one
forth and held it up for the inspection of his friend:</p>

<p>"Look here; here's all this Judy's clothes falling
to pieces again. You haven't got a needle and
thread, I suppose?"</p>

<p>The little man shook his head and scratched it
sadly, as he contemplated this condition of a
principal performer in his show. Seeing that
they were at a loss, the child said, timidly:</p>

<p>"I have a needle, sir, in my basket, and thread
too. Will you let me try to mend it for you?
I think I could do it neater than you could."</p>

<p>Even Mr. Codlin had nothing to urge against a
proposal so seasonable. Nell, kneeling down
beside the box, was soon busily engaged in her
task, and finished it in a wonderful way.</p>

<p>While she was thus at work, the merry little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
man looked at her with an interest which did not
appear to be any less when he glanced at her
helpless companion. When she had finished her
work he thanked her, and asked to what place
they were traveling.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no farther to-night, I think," said the
child, looking toward her grandfather.</p>

<p>"If you're wanting a place to stop at," the man
remarked. "I should advise you to take up at the
same house with us. That's it. The long low,
white house there. It's very cheap."</p>

<p>They went to the little inn, and when they had
been refreshed, the whole house hurried away into
an empty stable where the show stood, and where,
by the light of a few flaring candles stuck round
a hoop which hung by a line from the ceiling, it
was to be forthwith shown.</p>

<p>And now Mr. Thomas Codlin, after blowing
away at the Pan's pipes, took his station on one
side of the curtain which concealed the mover of
the figures, and, putting his hands in his pockets,
prepared to reply to all questions and remarks
of Punch, and to make a pretence of being his
most intimate private friend, of believing in him
to the fullest and most unlimited extent, of
knowing that Mr. Punch enjoyed day and night
a merry and glorious life in that temple, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
he was at all times and under every circumstance
the same wise and joyful person that all present
then beheld him.</p>

<p>The whole performance was applauded until
the old stable rang, and gifts were showered in
with a liberality which testified yet more strongly
to the general delight. Among the laughter none
was more loud and frequent than the old man's.
Nell's was unheard, for she, poor child, with her
head drooping on his shoulder, had fallen asleep,
and slept too soundly to be roused by any of his
efforts to awaken her to a part in his glee.</p>

<p>The supper was very good, but she was too
tired to eat, and yet would not leave the old man
until she had kissed him in his bed. He, happily
insensible to every care and anxiety, sat listening
with a vacant smile and admiring face to all that
his new friends said; and it was not until they
retired yawning to their room that he followed
the child up-stairs.</p>

<p>She had a little money, but it was very little;
and when that was gone they must begin to beg.
There was one piece of gold among it, and a need
might come when its worth to them would be increased
a hundred times. It would be best to hide
this coin, and never show it unless their case was
entirely desperate, and nothing else was left them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Her resolution taken, she sewed the piece of
gold into her dress, and going to bed with a lighter
heart sunk into a deep slumber.</p>

<p>"And where are you going to-day?" said the
little man the following morning, addressing himself
to Nell.</p>

<p>"Indeed I hardly know&mdash;we have not made up
our minds yet," replied the child.</p>

<p>"We're going on to the races," said the little
man. "If that's your way and you like to have
us for company, let us travel together. If you
prefer going alone, only say the word and you'll
find that we sha'n't trouble you."</p>

<p>"We'll go with you," said the old man. "Nell&mdash;with
them, with them."</p>

<p>The child thought for a moment, and knowing
that she must shortly beg, and could scarcely hope
to do so at a better place than where crowds of
rich ladies and gentlemen were met together for
enjoyment, determined to go with these men so
far. She therefore thanked the little man for his
offer, and said, glancing timidly toward his friend,
that they would if there was no objection to their
staying with them as far as the race-town.</p>

<p>And with these men they traveled forward on
the following day.</p>

<p>They made two long days' journey with their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
new companions, passing through villages and
towns, and meeting upon one occasion with two
young people walking upon stilts, who were also
going to the races.</p>

<p>And now they had come to the time when they
must beg their bread. Soon after sunrise the
second morning, she stole out, and, rambling into
some fields at a short distance, plucked a few wild
roses and such humble flowers, purposing to make
them into little nosegays and offer them to the
ladies in the carriages when the company arrived.
Her thoughts were not idle while she was thus
busy; when she returned and was seated beside
the old man, tying her flowers together, while the
two men lay dozing in the corner, she plucked him
by the sleeve, and, slightly glancing toward them,
said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Grandfather, don't look at those I talk of, and
don't seem as if I spoke of anything but what I am
about. What was that you told me before we
left the old house? That if they knew what we
were going to do, they would say that you were
mad, and part us?"</p>

<p>The old man turned to her with a look of wild
terror; but she checked him by a look, and bidding
him hold some flowers while she tied them
up, and so bringing her lips closer to his ear, said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know that was what you told me. You
needn't speak, dear. I recollect it very well. It
was not likely that I should forget it. Grandfather,
I have heard these men say they think that
we have secretly left our friends, and mean to carry
us before some gentleman and have us taken care
of and sent back. If you let your hand tremble
so, we can never get away from them, but if you're
only quiet now, we shall do so easily."</p>

<p>"How?" muttered the old man. "Dear Nell,
how? They will shut me up in a stone-room,
dark and cold, and chain me up to the wall, Nell&mdash;flog
me with whips, and never let me see thee
more!"</p>

<p>"You're trembling again," said the child.
"Keep close to me all day. Never mind them,
don't look at them, but me. I shall find a time
when we can steal away. When I do, mind you
come with me, and do not stop or speak a word.
Hush! That's all."</p>

<p>"Halloo! what are you up to, my dear?" said
Mr. Codlin, raising his head, and yawning.</p>

<p>"Making some nosegays," the child replied;
"I am going to try to sell some, these three days
of the races. Will you have one&mdash;as a present,
I mean?"</p>

<p>Mr. Codlin would have risen to receive it, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the child hurried toward him and placed it in his
hand, and he stuck it in his button-hole.</p>

<p>As the morning wore on, the tents at the race-course
assumed a gayer and more brilliant appearance,
and long lines of carriages came rolling softly
on the turf. Black-eyed gipsy girls, their heads
covered with showy handkerchiefs, came out to
tell fortunes, and pale, slender women with
wasted faces followed the footsteps of conjurers,
and counted the sixpences with anxious eyes long
before they were gained. As many of the children
as could be kept within bounds were stowed away,
with all the other signs of dirt and poverty, among
the donkeys, carts, and horses; and as many as
could not be thus disposed of ran in and out in all
directions, crept between people's legs and carriage
wheels, and came forth unharmed from under
horses' hoofs. The dancing-dogs, the stilts, the
little lady and the tall man, and all the other
attractions, with organs out of number and bands
innumerable, came out from the holes and corners
in which they had passed the night, and flourished
boldly in the sun.</p>

<p>Along the uncleared course, Short led his party,
sounding the brazen trumpet and speaking in
the voice of Punch; and at his heels went Thomas
Codlin, bearing the show as usual, and keeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
his eye on Nell and her grandfather, as they
rather lingered in the rear. The child bore upon
her arm the little basket with her flowers, and
sometimes stopped, with timid and modest looks,
to offer them at some gay carriage; but alas! there
were many bolder beggars there, gipsies who
promised husbands, and others skillful in their
trade; and although some ladies smiled gently
as they shook their heads, and others cried to the
gentlemen beside them, "See what a pretty face!"
they let the pretty face pass on, and never thought
that it looked tired or hungry.</p>

<p>There was but one lady who seemed to understand
the child, and she was one who sat alone in
a handsome carriage, while two young men in
dashing clothes, who had just stepped out from it,
talked and laughed loudly at a little distance,
appearing to forget her, quite. There were many
ladies all around, but they turned their backs, or
looked another way, or at the two young men
(not unfavorably at <i>them</i>), and left her to herself.
The lady motioned away a gipsy woman, eager
to tell her fortune, saying that it was told already
and had been for some years, but called the child
toward her, and, taking her flowers, put money
into her trembling hand, and bade her go home
and keep at home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Many a time they went up and down those long,
long lines, seeing everything but the horses and
the race; when the bell rung to clear the course,
going back to rest among the carts and donkeys,
and not coming out again until the heat was over.
Many a time, too, was Punch displayed in the
full glory of his humor; but all this while the eye of
Thomas Codlin was upon them, and to escape
without notice was almost impossible.</p>

<p>At length, late in the day, Mr. Codlin pitched
the show in a spot right in the middle of the
crowd, and the Punch and Judy were surrounded
by people who were watching the performance.</p>

<p>Short was moving the images, and knocking
them in the fury of the combat against the sides
of the show, the people were looking on with
laughing faces, and Mr. Codlin's face showed a
grim smile as his roving eye detected the hands of
thieves in the crowd going into waistcoat pockets.
If Nell and her grandfather were ever to get away
unseen, that was the very moment. They seized
it, and fled.</p>

<p>They made a path through booths and carriages
and throngs of people, and never once stopped to
look behind. The bell was ringing, and the
course was cleared by the time they reached the
ropes, but they dashed across it, paying no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
attention to the shouts and screeching that
assailed them for breaking in it, and, creeping
under the brow of the hill at a quick pace, made
for the open fields. At last they were free from
Codlin and Short.</p>

<p>That night they reached a little village in a
woody hollow. The village schoolmaster, a good
and gentle man, pitying their weariness, and
attracted by the child's sweetness and modesty,
gave them a lodging for the night; nor would he
let them leave him until two days more had
passed.</p>

<p>They journeyed on, when the time came that
they must wander forth again, by pleasant
country lanes; and as they passed, watching the
birds that perched and twittered in the branches
overhead, or listening to the songs that broke the
happy silence, their hearts were peaceful and free
from care. But by-and-by they came to a long
winding road which lengthened out far into the
distance, and though they still kept on, it was at
a much slower pace, for they were now very
weary.</p>

<p>The afternoon had worn away into a beautiful
evening, when they arrived at a point where the
road made a sharp turn and struck across a
common. On the border of this common, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
close to the hedge which divided it from the cultivated
fields, a caravan was drawn up to rest;
upon which they came so suddenly that they could
not have avoided it if they would. Do you know
what a "caravan" is? It is a sort of gipsy house
on wheels in which people live, while the house
moves from place to place.</p>

<p>It was not a shabby, dingy, dusty cart, but a
smart little house with white dimity curtains
hung over the windows, and window-shutters of
green picked out with panels of a staring red, in
which happily-contrasted colors the whole house
shone brilliant. Neither was it a poor caravan
drawn by a single donkey or feeble old horse, for a
pair of horses in pretty good condition were
released from the shafts and grazing on the frouzy
grass. Neither was it a gipsy caravan, for at the
open door (graced with a bright brass knocker)
sat a Christian lady, stout and comfortable to look
upon, who wore a large bonnet trembling with
bows. And that it was not a caravan of poor
people was clear from what this lady was doing;
for she was taking her tea. The tea-things,
including a bottle of rather suspicious looks and
a cold knuckle of ham, were set forth upon a
drum, covered with a white napkin; and there, as
if at the most convenient round-table in all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
world, sat this roving lady, taking her tea and
enjoying the prospect.</p>

<p>It happened at that moment that the lady of
the caravan had her cup (which, that everything
about her might be of a stout and comfortable
kind, was a breakfast cup) to her lips, and that
having her eyes lifted to the sky in her enjoyment
of the full flavor of her tea, it happened that, being
thus agreeably engaged, she did not see the
travelers when they first came up. It was not
until she was in the act of setting down the cup,
and drawing a long breath after the exertion of
swallowing its contents, that the lady of the
caravan beheld an old man and a young child
walking slowly by, and glancing at her proceedings
with eyes of modest, but hungry admiration.</p>

<p>"Hey!" cried the lady of the caravan, scooping
the crumbs out of her lap and swallowing
the same before wiping her lips. "Yes, to be
sure&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Who won the Helter-Skelter Plate,
child?"</p>

<p>"Won what, ma'am?" asked Nell.</p>

<p>"The Helter-Skelter Plate at the races, child&mdash;the
plate that was run for on the second day."</p>

<p>"On the second day, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Second day! Yes, second day," repeated
the lady, with an air of impatience. "Can't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
you say who won the Helter-Skelter Plate when
you're asked the question civilly?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Don't know!" repeated the lady of the caravan;
"why, you were there. I saw you with my
own eyes."</p>

<p>Nell was not a little alarmed to hear this, supposing
that the lady might be intimately acquainted
with the firm of Short and Codlin; but
what followed tended to put her at her ease.</p>

<p>"And very sorry I was," said the lady of the
caravan, "to see you in company with a Punch&mdash;a
low, common, vulgar wretch, that people should
scorn to look at."</p>

<p>"I was not there by choice," returned the child;
"we didn't know our way, and the two men were
very kind to us, and let us travel with them.
Do you&mdash;do you know them, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Know 'em, child?" cried the lady of the caravan,
in a sort of shriek. "Know <i>them</i>! But
you're young and ignorant, and that's your excuse
for asking sich a question. Do I look as if I
know'd 'em? does the caravan look as if <i>it</i> know'd
'em?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, no," said the child, fearing she
had committed some grievous fault. "I beg
your pardon."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>The lady of the caravan was in the act of
gathering her tea things together preparing to clear
the table, but noting the child's anxious manner,
she hesitated and stopped. The child courtesied,
and, giving her hand to the old man, had already
got some fifty yards or so away, when the lady of
the caravan called to her to return.</p>

<p>"Come nearer, nearer still," said she, beckoning
to her to ascend the steps. "Are you hungry,
child?"</p>

<p>"Not very, but we are tired, and it's&mdash;it <i>is</i> a
long way&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, hungry or not, you had better have some
tea," rejoined her new acquaintance. "I suppose
you are agreeable to that old gentleman?"</p>

<p>The grandfather humbly pulled off his hat and
thanked her. The lady of the caravan then bade
him come up the steps likewise, but the drum
proving an inconvenient table for two, they went
down again, and sat upon the grass, where she
handed down to them the tea-tray, the bread and
butter, and the knuckle of ham.</p>

<p>"Set 'em out near the hind wheels child, that's
the best place," said their friend, superintending
the arrangement from above. "Now hand up the
tea-pot for a little more hot water and a pinch of
fresh tea, and then both of you eat and drink as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
much as you can, and don't spare anything;
that's all I ask of you."</p>

<p>The mistress of the caravan, saying the girl and
her grandfather could not be very heavy, invited
them to go along with them for a while, for which
Nell thanked her with all her heart.</p>

<p>When they had traveled slowly forward for
some short distance, Nell ventured to steal a look
round the caravan and observe it more closely.
One-half of it&mdash;that part in which the comfortable
proprietress was then seated&mdash;was carpeted, and
so divided the farther end as to form a sleeping-place,
made after the fashion of a berth on board
ship, which was shaded, like the little windows,
with fair white curtains, and looked comfortable
enough, though by what kind of gymnastic exercise
the lady of the caravan ever contrived to
get into it was a mystery. The other half
served for a kitchen, and was fitted up with a stove
whose small chimney passed through the roof.</p>

<p>The mistress sat looking at the child for a long
time in silence, and then, getting up, brought out
from a corner a large roll of canvas about a yard
in width, which she laid upon the floor and spread
open with her foot until it nearly reached from one
end of the caravan to the other.</p>

<p>"There, child," she said, "read that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Nell walked down it, and read aloud, in enormous
black letters, the inscription, "<span class="smcap">Jarley's
Wax-work</span>."</p>

<p>"Read it again," said the lady, complacently.</p>

<p>"Jarley's Wax-work," repeated Nell.</p>

<p>"That's me," said the lady. "I am Mrs.
Jarley."</p>

<p>Giving the child an encouraging look, the lady
of the caravan unfolded another scroll, whereon
was the inscription, "One hundred figures the
full size of life;" and then another scroll, on which
was written, "The only stupendous collection
of real wax-work in the world;" and then several
smaller scrolls, with such inscriptions as "Now
exhibiting within"&mdash;"The genuine and only
Jarley"&mdash;"Jarley's unrivaled collection"&mdash;"Jarley
is the delight of the Nobility and Gentry"&mdash;"The
Royal Family are the patrons of Jarley."
When she had exhibited these large painted signs
to the astonished child, she brought forth specimens
of the lesser notices in the shape of hand-bills,
some of which were printed in the form of
verses on popular times, as "Believe me if all
Jarley's wax-work so rare"&mdash;"I saw thy show
in youthful prime"&mdash;"Over the water to Jarley;"
while, to satisfy all tastes, others were composed
with a view to the lighter and merrier spirits, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
a verse on the favorite air of "If I had a donkey,"
beginning</p>

<div class='poem'>
If I know'd a donkey wot wouldn't go<br />
To see Mrs. Jarley's wax-work show,<br />
Do you think I'd own him?<br />
Oh no, no!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Then run to Jarley's&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>besides several compositions in prose, pretending
to be dialogues between the Emperor of China
and an oyster.</div>

<p>"I never saw any wax-work, ma'am," said
Nell. "Is it funnier than Punch?"</p>

<p>"Funnier!" said Mrs. Jarley in a shrill voice.
"It is not funny at all."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Nell, with all possible humility.</p>

<p>"It isn't funny at all," repeated Mrs. Jarley.
"It's calm and&mdash;what's that word again&mdash;critical?&mdash;no&mdash;classical,
that's it&mdash;it's calm and
classical. No low beatings and knockings about,
no jokings and squeakings like your precious
Punches, but always the same, with a constantly
unchanging air of coldness and dignity; and so like
life that, if wax-work only spoke and walked about
you'd hardly know the difference. I won't go
so far as to say that, as it is, I've seen wax-work
quite like life, but I've certainly seen some life
that was exactly like wax-work."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>This conference at length concluded, she beckoned
Nell to sit down.</p>

<p>"And the old gentleman, too," said Mrs. Jarley;
"for I want to have a word with him. Do you
want a good place for your granddaughter,
master? If you do, I can put her in the way of
getting one. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I can't leave her," answered the old man.
"We can't separate. What would become of
me without her?"</p>

<p>"If you're really ready to employ yourself,"
said Mrs. Jarley, "there would be plenty for you
to do in the way of helping to dust the figures,
and take the checks, and so forth. What I
want your granddaughter for is to point 'em out
to the company; they would be soon learned and
she has a way with her that people wouldn't
think unpleasant, though she <i>does</i> come after
me; for I've been always accustomed to go round
with visitors myself, which I should keep on doing
now, only that my spirits make a little rest absolutely
necessary. It's not a common offer,
bear in mind," said the lady, rising into the tone
and manner in which she was accustomed to address
her audiences; "it's Jarley's wax-work, remember.
The duty's very light and genteel,
the company particularly select, the exhibition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
takes place in assembly-rooms, town-halls, large
rooms at inns, or auction galleries. There is none
of your open-air wondering at Jarley's, recollect;
there is no tarpaulin and sawdust at Jarley's,
remember. Every promise made in the hand-bills
is kept to the utmost, and the whole forms
an effect of splendor hitherto unknown in this
kingdom. Remember that the price of admission
is only sixpence, and that this is an opportunity
which may never occur again!"</p>

<p>"We are very much obliged to you, ma'am,"
said Nell, "and thankfully accept your offer."</p>

<p>"And you'll never be sorry for it," returned
Mrs. Jarley. "I'm pretty sure of that. So
as that's all settled, let us have a bit of
supper."</p>

<p>Rumbling along with most unwonted noise, the
caravan stopped at last at the place of exhibition,
where Nell came down from the wagon among an
admiring group of children, who evidently supposed
her to be an important part of the curiosities,
and were almost ready to believe that her
grandfather was a cunning device in wax. The
chests were taken out of the van for the figures
with all haste, and taken in to be unlocked by
Mrs. Jarley, who, attended by George and the
driver, arranged their contents (consisting of red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
festoons and other ornamental work) to make the
best show in the decoration of the room.</p>

<p>When the festoons were all put up as tastily as
they might be, the wonderful collection was uncovered;
and there were shown, on a raised platform
some two feet from the floor, running round
the room and parted from the rude public by a
crimson rope, breast high, a large number of
sprightly waxen images of famous people, singly
and in groups, clad in glittering dresses of various
climes and times, and standing more or less unsteadily
upon their legs, with their eyes very wide
open, and their nostrils very much inflated, and
the muscles of their legs, and arms very strongly
developed, and all their faces expressing great
surprise. All the gentlemen were very narrow
in the breast, and very blue about the beards; and
all the ladies were wonderful figures; and all
the ladies and all the gentlemen were looking
intensely nowhere, and staring with tremendous
earnestness at nothing.</p>

<p>When Nell had shown her first wonder at
this glorious sight, Mrs. Jarley ordered the
room to be cleared of all but herself and the child,
and, sitting herself down in an arm-chair in the
center, presented Nell with a willow wand, long
used by herself for pointing out the characters,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and was at great pains to instruct her in her
duty.</p>

<p>"That," said Mrs. Jarley, in her exhibition
tone, as Nell touched a figure at the beginning of
the platform, "is an unfortunate maid of honor
in the time of Queen Elizabeth, who died from
pricking her finger in consequence of working
upon a Sunday. Observe the blood which is
trickling from her finger; also the gold-eyed
needle of the period, with which she is at work."</p>

<p>All this Nell repeated twice or thrice&mdash;pointing
to the finger and the needle at the right times;
and then passed on to the next.</p>

<p>"That, ladies and gentlemen," said Mrs. Jarley,
"is Jasper Packlemerton, of terrible memory,
who courted and married fourteen wives, and
destroyed them all, by tickling the soles of their
feet when they were sleeping in the consciousness
of innocence and virtue. On being brought to the
scaffold and asked if he was sorry for what he had
done, he replied yes, he was sorry for having let
'em off so easy, and hoped all Christian husbands
would pardon him the offense. Let this be a
warning to all young ladies to be particular in
the character of the gentlemen of their choice.
Observe that his fingers are curled as if in the act
of tickling, and that his face is represented with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
wink, as he appeared when committing his barbarous
murders."</p>

<p>When Nell knew all about Mr. Packlemerton,
and could say it without faltering, Mrs. Jarley
passed on to the fat man, and then to the thin
man, the tall man, the short man, the old lady
who died of dancing at a hundred and thirty-two,
the wild boy of the woods, the woman who poisoned
fourteen families with pickled walnuts,
and other historical characters and interesting
but misguided individuals. And so well did Nell
profit by her instructions, and so apt was she to
remember them, that by the time they had been
shut up together for a couple of hours, she was in
full possession of the history of the whole establishment,
and perfectly able to tell the stories of the
wax-work to visitors.</p>

<p>For some time her life and the life of the poor
vacant old man passed quietly and happily. They
traveled from place to place with Mrs. Jarley;
Nell spoke her piece, with the wand in her hand,
before the waxen images; and her grandfather
in a dull way dusted the images when he was told
to do so.</p>

<p>But heavier sorrow was yet to come. One
night, a holiday night for them, Neil and her
grandfather went out to walk. A terrible thunderstorm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
coming on, they were forced to take
refuge in a small public house; and here they saw
some shabbily dressed and wicked looking men
were playing cards. The old man watched them
with increasing interest and excitement, until his
whole appearance underwent a complete change.
His face was flushed and eager, his teeth set.
With a hand that trembled violently he seized
Nell's little purse, and in spite of her pleadings
joined in the game, gambling with such a savage
thirst for gain that the distressed and frightened
child could almost better have borne to see him
dead. It was long after midnight when the play
came to an end; and they were forced to remain
where they were until the morning. And in the
night the child was wakened from her troubled
sleep to find a figure in the room&mdash;a figure busying
its hands about her garments, while its face
was turned to her, listening and looking lest she
should awake. It was her grandfather himself,
his white face pinched and sharpened by the greediness
which made his eyes unnaturally bright,
counting the money of which his hands were
robbing her.</p>

<p>Evening after evening, after that night, the
old man would steal away, not to return until
the night was far spent, demanding, wildly, money.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
And at last there came an hour when the child
overheard him, tempted beyond his feeble powers
of resistance, undertake to find more money to
feed the desperate passion which had laid its hold
upon his weakness by robbing the kind Mrs.
Jarley, who had done so much for them. The
poor old man had become so weak in his mind,
that he did not understand how wicked was his
act.</p>

<p>That night the child took her grandfather by
the hand and led him forth. Through the strait
streets and narrow outskirts of the town their
trembling feet passed quickly; the child sustained
by one idea&mdash;that they were flying from
wickedness and disgrace, and that she could save
her grandfather only by her firmness unaided by
one word of advice or any helping hand; the old
man following her as though she had been an
angel messenger sent to lead him where she would.</p>

<p>The hardest part of all their wanderings was
now before them. They slept in the open air
that night, and on the following morning some
men offered to take them a long distance on their
barge on the river. These men, though they
were not unkindly, were very rugged, noisy
fellows, and they drank and quarreled fearfully
among themselves, to Nell's inexpressible terror.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
It rained, too, heavily, and she was wet and cold.
At last they reached the great city whither the
barge was bound, and here they wandered up
and down, being now penniless, and watched the
faces of those who passed, to find among them a
ray of encouragement or hope. Ill in body, and
sick to death at heart, the child needed her utmost
courage and will even to creep along.</p>

<p>They lay down that night, and the next night
too, with nothing between them and the sky; a
penny loaf was all they had had that day, and
when the third morning came, it found the child
much weaker, yet she made no complaint. The
great city with its many factories hemmed them
in on every side, and seemed to shut out hope.</p>

<p>Faint and spiritless as they were, its streets
were terrible to them. After humbly asking for
relief at some few doors, and being driven away,
they agreed to make their way out of it as speedily
as they could, and try if the people living in some
lone house beyond would have more pity on their
worn out state.</p>

<p>They were dragging themselves along through
the last street, and the child felt that the time
was close at hand when her enfeebled powers
would bear no more. There appeared before
them, at this moment, going in the same direction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
as themselves, a traveler on foot, who, with a
bundle of clothing strapped to his back, leaned
upon a stout stick as he walked, and read from a
book which he held in his other hand.</p>

<p>It was not an easy matter to come up with him
and ask his aid, for he walked fast, and was a
little distance in advance. At length he stopped,
to look more attentively at some passage in his
book. Encouraged by a ray of hope, the child
shot on before her grandfather, and, going close to
the stranger without rousing him by the sound of
her footsteps, began, in a few faint words, to beg
his help.</p>

<p>He turned his head. The child clapped her
hands together, uttered a wild shriek, and fell
senseless at his feet.</p>

<p>It was the poor schoolmaster. No other than
the poor schoolmaster. Scarcely less moved and
surprised by the sight of the child than she had
been on recognizing him, he stood, for a moment,
silent, without even the presence of mind to raise
her from the ground.</p>

<p>But, quickly recovering himself, he threw down
his stick and book, and, dropping on one knee
beside her, tried simple means as came to his
mind, to restore her to herself; while her grandfather,
standing idly by, wrung his hands, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
begged her, with many words of love, to speak
to him, were it only a whisper.</p>

<p>"She appears to be quite worn out," said the
schoolmaster, glancing upward into his face.
"You have used up all her strength, friend."</p>

<p>"She is dying of want," answered the old man.
"I never thought how weak and ill she was till
now."</p>

<p>Casting a look upon him, half-angry and half-pitiful,
the schoolmaster took the child in his
arms, and, bidding the old man gather up her
little basket and follow him directly, bore her
away at his utmost speed.</p>

<p>There was a small inn within sight, to which, it
would seem, he had been walking when so unexpectedly
overtaken. Toward this place he hurried
with his unconscious burden, and rushing
into the kitchen, and calling upon the company
there assembled to make way for God's sake, laid
it down on a chair before the fire.</p>

<p>The company, who rose in confusion on the
schoolmaster's entrance, did as people usually
do under such circumstances. Everybody called
for his or her favorite remedy, which nobody
brought; each cried for more air, at the same
time carefully shutting out what air there was,
by closing round the object of sympathy; and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
wondered why somebody else didn't do what it
never appeared to occur to them might be done
by themselves.</p>

<p>The landlady, however, who had more readiness
and activity than any of them, and who seemed
to understand the case more quickly, soon came
running in, with a little hot medicine, followed by
her servant-girl, carrying vinegar, hartshorn,
smelling-salts, and such other restoratives; which,
being duly given, helped the child so far as to
enable her to thank them in a faint voice, and to
hold out her hand to the poor schoolmaster, who
stood, with an anxious face, near her side.
Without suffering her to speak another word, or
so much as to stir a finger any more, the women
straightway carried her off to bed; and, having
covered her up warm, bathed her cold feet, and
wrapped them in flannel, they sent a messenger for
the doctor.</p>

<p>The doctor, who was a red-nosed gentleman
with a great bunch of seals dangling below a
waistcoat of ribbed black satin, arrived with all
speed, and taking his seat by the bedside of poor
Nell, drew out his watch, and felt her pulse.
Then he looked at her tongue, then he felt her
pulse again, and while he did so, he eyed the half-emptied
wine-glass as if in profound abstraction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should give her," said the doctor at length,
"a teaspoonful, every now and then, of hot
medicine."</p>

<p>"Why, that's exactly what we've done, sir!"
said the delighted landlady.</p>

<p>"I should also," observed the doctor, who had
passed the foot-bath on the stairs, "I should also,"
said the doctor, in a very wise tone of voice,
"put her feet in hot water and wrap them up in
flannel. I should likewise," said the doctor, with
increased solemnity, "give her something light
for supper&mdash;the wing of a roasted chicken now&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, goodness gracious me, sir, it's cooking
at the kitchen fire this instant!" cried the landlady.
And so indeed it was, for the schoolmaster had
ordered it to be put down, and it was getting on
so well that the doctor might have smelled it if he
had tried; perhaps he did.</p>

<p>"You may then," said the doctor, rising
gravely, "give her a glass of hot mulled port-wine,
if she likes wine&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a piece of toast, sir?" suggested the landlady.</p>

<p>"Ay," said the doctor, in a very dignified tone,
"And a toast&mdash;of bread. But be very particular
to make it of bread, if you please, ma'am."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>With which parting advice, slowly and solemnly
given, the doctor departed, leaving the whole
house in admiration of that wisdom which agreed
so closely with their own. Everybody said he was
a very shrewd doctor indeed, and knew perfectly
what people's bodies needed; which there appears
some reason to suppose he did.</p>

<p>While her supper was preparing, the child fell
into a refreshing sleep, from which they were
obliged to rouse her when it was ready. As she
showed extraordinary uneasiness on learning that
her grandfather was below stairs, and as she was
greatly troubled at the thought of their being
apart, he took his supper with her. Finding her
still very anxious for the old man, they made him
up a bed in an inner room, to which he soon went.
The key of this room happened by good-fortune
to be on that side of the door which was in Nell's
room; she turned it on him when the landlady
had withdrawn, and crept to bed again with a
thankful heart.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster sat for a long time smoking
his pipe by the kitchen fire, which was now
deserted, thinking, with a very happy face, on the
fortunate chance which had brought him at just
the right moment to the child's assistance.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster, as it appeared, was on his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
way to a new home. And when the child had
recovered somewhat from her hunger and weariness,
it was arranged that she and her grandfather
should go with him to the village whither he was
bound, and that he should endeavor to find them
some work by which they could get their
living.</p>

<p>It was a lonely little village, lying among the
quiet country scenes Nell loved. And here, her
grandfather being peaceful and at rest, a great
calm fell upon the spirit of the child. Often she
would steal into the church, and, sitting down
among the quiet figures carved upon the tombs,
would think of the summer days and the bright
spring-time that would come; of the rays of sun
that would fall in, aslant those sleeping forms;
of the songs of birds, and the sweet air that would
steal in. What if the spot awakened thoughts
of death! It would be no pain to sleep amid such
sights and sounds as these. For the time was
drawing nearer every day when Nell was to rest
indeed. She never murmured or complained,
but faded like a light upon a summer's evening
and died. Day after day and all day long, the
old man, broken-hearted and with no love or care
for anything in life, would sit beside her grave
with her straw hat and the little basket she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
been used to carry, waiting till she should come
to him again. At last they found him lying dead
upon the stone. And in the church where they
had often prayed and mused and lingered, hand
in hand, the child and the old man slept together.</p>

<h2>VII.</h2>

<h3>LITTLE DAVID COPPERFIELD.</h3>


<div class='cap'>I, little David Copperfield, lived with my mother
in a pretty house in the village of Blunderstone
in Suffolk. I had never known my
father, who died before I could remember anything,
and I had neither brothers nor sisters. I
was fondly loved by my pretty young mother,
and our kind, good servant, Peggotty, and was
a very happy little fellow. We had very few
friends, and the only relation my mother talked
about was an aunt of my father's, a tall and
rather terrible old lady, from all accounts, who
had once been to see us when I was quite a tiny
baby, and had been so angry to find I was not a
little girl that she had left the house quite offended,
and had never been heard of since. One
visitor, a tall dark gentleman, I did not like at
all, and was rather inclined to be jealous that my
mother should be so friendly with the stranger.</div>

<p>Peggotty and I were sitting one night by the
parlor fire, alone. I had been reading to Peggotty
about crocodiles. I was tired of reading, and
dead sleepy; but having leave, as a high treat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to sit up until my mother came home from spending
the evening at a neighbor's, I would rather
have died upon my post (of course) than have
gone to bed. I had reached that stage of sleepiness
when Peggotty seemed to swell and grow
immensely large. I propped my eyelids open
with my two forefingers, and looked perseveringly
at her as she sat at work; at the little house with
a thatched roof, where she kept her yard-measure;
at her work-box with a sliding-lid, with a view
of St. Paul's Cathedral (with a pink dome)
painted on the top; at the brass thimble on her
finger; at herself, whom I thought lovely. I felt
so sleepy that I knew if I lost sight of anything,
for a moment, I was gone.</p>

<p>"Peggotty," says I, suddenly, "were you ever
married?"</p>

<p>"Lord, Master Davy!" replied Peggotty.
"What's put marriage in your head?"</p>

<p>She answered with such a start that it quite
awoke me. And then she stopped in her work and
looked at me, with her needle drawn out to its
thread's length.</p>

<p>"But <i>were</i> you ever married, Peggotty?" says
I. "You are a very handsome woman, ain't
you?"</p>

<p>"Me handsome, Davy!" said Peggotty. "Lawk,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
no, my dear! But what put marriage in your
head?"</p>

<p>"I don't know! You mustn't marry more than
one person at a time, may you, Peggotty?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," says Peggotty, with the
promptest decision.</p>

<p>"But if you marry a person, and the person
dies, why then you may marry another person,
mayn't you, Peggotty?"</p>

<p>"You <span class="smcap">may</span>," says Peggotty, "if you choose, my
dear. That's a matter of opinion."</p>

<p>"But what is your opinion, Peggotty?" said I.</p>

<p>I asked her and looked curiously at her, because
she looked so curiously at me.</p>

<p>"My opinion is," said Peggotty, taking her eyes
from me, after waiting a little, and going on with
her work, "that I never was married myself,
Master Davy, and that I don't expect to be.
That's all I know about the subject."</p>

<p>"You ain't cross, I suppose, Peggotty, are you?"
said I, after sitting quiet for a minute.</p>

<p>I really thought she was, she had been so short
with me; but I was quite mistaken; for she laid
aside her work (which was a stocking of her own)
and opening her arms wide, took my curly head
within them, and gave it a good squeeze. I
know it was a good squeeze, because, being very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
plump, whenever she made any little exertion
after she was dressed, some of the buttons on the
back of her flew off. And I recollect two bursting
to the opposite side of the parlor while she was
hugging me.</p>

<p>One day Peggotty asked me if I would like to
go with her on a visit to her brother at Yarmouth.</p>

<p>"Is your brother an agreeable man, Peggotty?"
I inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, what an agreeable man he is!" cried Peggotty.
"Then there's the sea, and the boats and
ships, and the fishermen, and the beach. And
'Am to play with."</p>

<p>Ham was her nephew. I was quite anxious
to go when I heard of all these delights; but my
mother, what would she do all alone? Peggotty
told me my mother was going to pay a visit to
some friends, and would be sure to let me go.
So all was arranged, and we were to start the
next day in the carrier's cart. I was so eager that
I wanted to put my hat and coat on the night
before! But when the time came to say good-by
to my dear mamma, I cried a little, for I had
never left her before. It was rather a slow way of
traveling, and I was very tired and sleepy when I
arrived at Yarmouth, and found Ham waiting to
meet me. He was a great strong fellow, six feet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
high, and took me on his back and the box under
his arm to carry both to the house. I was delighted
to find that this house was made of a real big
black boat, with a door and windows cut in the
side, and an iron funnel sticking out of the roof
for a chimney. Inside, it was very cozy and clean,
and I had a tiny bedroom in the stern. I was
very much pleased to find a dear little girl, about
my own age, to play with, and after tea I said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Peggotty."</p>

<p>"Sir," says he.</p>

<p>"Did you give your son the name of Ham
because you lived in a sort of ark?"</p>

<p>Mr. Peggotty seemed to think it a deep idea,
but answered:</p>

<p>"No, sir. I never giv' him no name."</p>

<p>"Who gave him that name, then?" said I,
putting question number two of the catechism to
Mr. Peggotty.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, his father giv' it him," said Mr.
Peggotty.</p>

<p>"I thought you were his father!"</p>

<p>"My brother Joe was <i>his</i> father," said Mr.
Peggotty.</p>

<p>"Dead, Mr. Peggotty?" I hinted, after a respectful
pause.</p>

<p>"Drowndead," said Mr. Peggotty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>I was very much surprised that Mr. Peggotty
was not Ham's father, and began to wonder
whether I was mistaken about his relationship to
anybody else there. I was so curious to know
that I made up my mind to have it out with Mr.
Peggotty.</p>

<p>"Little Em'ly," I said, glancing at her. "She
is your daughter, isn't she, Mr. Peggotty?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. My brother-in-law, Tom, was <i>her</i>
father."</p>

<p>I couldn't help it. "&mdash;&mdash;Dead, Mr. Peggotty?"
I hinted, after another respectful silence.</p>

<p>"Drowndead," said Mr. Peggotty.</p>

<p>I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject, but
had not got to the bottom of it yet, and must get
to the bottom somehow. So I said:</p>

<p>"Haven't you <i>any</i> children, Mr. Peggotty?"</p>

<p>"No, master," he answered, with a short laugh.
"I'm a bacheldore."</p>

<p>"A bachelor!" I said, astonished. "Why,
who's that, Mr. Peggotty?" Pointing to the
person in the apron who was knitting.</p>

<p>"That's Missis Gummidge," said Mr. Peggotty.</p>

<p>"Gummidge, Mr. Peggotty?"</p>

<p>But at this point Peggotty&mdash;I mean my own
Peggotty&mdash;made such impressive motions to me
not to ask any more questions, that I could only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sit and look at all the company, until it was time
to go to bed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gummidge lived with them too, and did
the cooking and cleaning, for she was a poor widow
and had no home of her own. I thought Mr.
Peggotty was very good to take all these people
to live with him, and I was quite right, for Mr.
Peggotty was only a poor man himself and had
to work hard to get a living.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as morning shone upon the
oyster-shell frame of my mirror I was out of bed,
and out with tittle Em'ly, picking up stones upon
the beach.</p>

<p>"You're quite a sailor I suppose?" I said to
Em'ly. I don't know that I supposed anything
of the kind, but I felt it proper to say something;
and a shining sail close to us made such a pretty
little image of itself, at the moment, in her bright
eye, that it came into my head to say this.</p>

<p>"No," replied Em'ly, shaking her head, "I'm
afraid of the sea."</p>

<p>"Afraid!" I said, with a becoming air of boldness,
and looking very big at the mighty ocean.
"I ain't."</p>

<p>"Ah! but it's cruel," said Em'ly. "I have seen
it very cruel to some of our men. I have seen
it tear a boat as big as our house all to pieces."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope it wasn't the boat that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That father was drowned in?" said Em'ly.
"No. Not that one, I never see that boat."</p>

<p>"Nor him?" I asked her.</p>

<p>Little Em'ly shook her head. "Not to remember!"</p>

<p>Here was something remarkable. I immediately
went into an explanation how I had never
seen my own father; and how my mother and I
had always lived by ourselves in the happiest
state imaginable, and lived so then, and always
meant to live so; and how my father's grave was
in the churchyard near our house, and shaded by a
tree, beneath the boughs of which I had walked
and heard the birds sing many a pleasant morning.
But there were some differences between Em'ly's
orphanhood and mine, it appeared. She had lost
her mother before her father, and where her
father's grave was no one knew, except that it
was somewhere in the depths of the sea.</p>

<p>"Besides," said Em'ly, as she looked about
for shells and pebbles, "your father was a gentleman
and your mother is a lady; and my father
was a fisherman and my mother was a fisherman's
daughter, and my Uncle Dan is a fisherman."</p>

<p>"Dan is Mr. Peggotty, is he?" said I.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 321px;">

</div>

<p>"Uncle&mdash;yonder," answered Em'ly, nodding
at the boat-house.</p>

<p>"Yes. I mean him. He must be very good,
I should think."</p>

<p>"Good?" said Em'ly. "If I was ever to be a
lady, I'd give him a sky-blue coat with diamond
buttons, nankeen trousers, a red velvet waistcoat,
a cocked hat, a large gold watch, a silver pipe, and
a box of money."</p>

<p>I said I had no doubt that Mr. Peggotty well
deserved these treasures.</p>

<p>Little Em'ly had stopped and looked up at the
sky while she named these articles, as if they
were a glorious vision. We went on again picking
up shells and pebbles.</p>

<p>"You would like to be a lady?" I said.</p>

<p>Em'ly looked at me, and laughed and nodded
"yes."</p>

<p>"I should like it very much. We would all be
gentlefolks together, then. Me, and uncle, and
Ham, and Mrs. Gummidge. We wouldn't mind
then, when there come stormy weather. Not for
our own sakes, I mean. We would for the poor
fishermen's, to be sure, and we'd help 'em with
money when they come to any hurt."</p>

<p>I was quite sorry to leave these kind people and
my dear little companion, but I was glad to think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
I should get back to my own dear mamma. When
I reached home, however, I found a great change.
My mother was married to the dark man I did not
like, whose name was Mr. Murdstone, and he was
a stern, hard man, who had no love for me, and
did not allow my mother to pet and indulge me as
she had done before. Mr. Murdstone's sister
came to live with us, and as she was even more
difficult to please than her brother, and disliked
boys, my life was no longer a happy one. I tried
to be good and obedient, for I knew it made my
mother very unhappy to see me punished and
found fault with. I had always had lessons with
my mother, and as she was patient and gentle,
I had enjoyed learning to read, but now I had a
great many very hard lessons to do, and was so
frightened and shy when Mr. and Miss Murdstone
were in the room, that I did not get on at all well,
and was continually in disgrace.</p>

<p>Let me remember how it used to be, and bring
one morning back again.</p>

<p>I come into the second-best parlor after breakfast,
with my books, and an exercise-book and a
slate. My mother is ready for me at her writing-desk,
but not half so ready as Mr. Murdstone in his
easy-chair by the window (though he pretends to
be reading a book), or as Miss Murdstone, sitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
near my mother stringing steel beads. The very
sight of these two has such an influence over me
that I begin to feel the words I have been at infinite
pains to get into my head all sliding away,
and going I don't know where. I wonder where
they <i>do</i> go, by-the-by?</p>

<p>I hand the first book to my mother. Perhaps
it is a grammar, perhaps a history, or geography.
I take a last drowning look at the page as I give
it into her hand, and start off aloud at a racing
pace while I have got it fresh. I trip over a word.
Mr. Murdstone looks up. I trip over another
word. Miss Murdstone looks up. I redden,
tumble over half a dozen words and stop. I
think my mother would show me the book if
she dared, but she does not dare, and she says
softly:</p>

<p>"Oh, Davy, Davy!"</p>

<p>"Now, Clara," says Mr. Murdstone, "be firm
with the boy. Don't say, 'Oh, Davy, Davy!'
That's childish. He knows his lesson, or he does
not know it."</p>

<p>"He does <i>not</i> know it," Miss Murdstone interposes
awfully.</p>

<p>"I am really afraid he does not," says my
mother.</p>

<p>"Then you see, Clara," returns Miss Murdstone,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
"you should just give him the book back, and
make him know it."</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," says my mother; "that is
what I intend to do, my dear Jane. Now, Davy,
try once more, and don't be stupid."</p>

<p>I obey the first clause of my mother's words
by trying once more, but am not so successful
with the second, for I am very stupid. I tumble
down before I get to the old place, at a point where
I was all right before, and stop to think. But I
can't think about the lesson. I think of the number
of yards of net in Miss Murdstone's cap, or of
the price of Mr. Murdstone's dressing-gown, or
any such ridiculous matter that I have no business
with, and don't want to have anything at all to do
with. Mr. Murdstone makes a movement of
impatience which I have been expecting for a long
time. Miss Murdstone does the same. My
mother glances submissively at them, shuts the
book, and lays it by, to be worked out when my
other tasks are done.</p>

<p>There is a pile of these tasks very soon, and it
swells like a rolling snowball. The bigger it gets,
the more stupid <i>I</i> get. The case is so hopeless, and
I feel that I am wallowing in such a bog of nonsense,
that I give up all idea of getting out, and abandon
myself to my fate. The despairing way in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
my mother and I look at each other, as I blunder
on, is truly melancholy. But the greatest effect
in these miserable lessons is when my mother
(thinking nobody is observing her) tries to give
me the cue by the motion of her lips. At that
instant, Miss Murdstone, who has been lying in
wait for nothing else all along says in a deep warning
voice:</p>

<p>"Clara!"</p>

<p>My mother starts, colors, and smiles faintly.
Mr. Murdstone comes out of his chair, takes the
book, throws it at me, or boxes my ears with it,
and turns me out of the room by the shoulders.</p>

<p>My only pleasure was to go up into a little room
at the top of the house where I had found a number
of books that had belonged to my own father,
and I would sit and read Robinson Crusoe, and
many tales of travels and adventures, and I
imagined myself to be sometimes one and sometimes
another hero, and went about for days
with the centre-piece out of an old set of boot-trees,
pretending to be a captain in the British
Royal Navy.</p>

<p>One morning when I went into the parlor with
my books, I found my mother looking anxious,
Miss Murdstone looking firm, and Mr. Murdstone
binding something round the bottom of a cane&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
lithe and limber cane, which he left off binding
when I came in, and poised and switched in the
air.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Clara," said Mr. Murdstone, "I
have often been flogged myself."</p>

<p>"To be sure; of course," said Miss Murdstone.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear Jane," faltered my mother,
meekly. "But&mdash;but do you think it did Edward
good?"</p>

<p>"Do you think it did Edward harm, Clara?"
asked Mr. Murdstone, gravely.</p>

<p>"That's the point!" said his sister.</p>

<p>To this my mother returned, "Certainly, my
dear Jane," and said no more.</p>

<p>I felt afraid that all this had something to do
with myself, and sought Mr. Murdstone's eye as
it lighted on mine.</p>

<p>"Now, David," he said&mdash;and I saw that cast
again, as he said it&mdash;"you must be far more careful
to-day than usual." He gave the cane another
poise and another switch; and having
finished his preparation of it, laid it down beside
him, with an expressive look, and took up his
book.</p>

<p>This was a good freshener to my memory, as a
beginning. I felt the words of my lessons slipping
off, not one by one, or line by line, but by the entire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
page. I tried to lay hold of them; but they
seemed, if I may so express it, to have put skates
on, and to skim away from me with a smoothness
there was no checking.</p>

<p>We began badly, and went on worse. I had
come in with an idea of doing better than usual,
thinking that I was very well prepared; but it
turned out to be quite a mistake. Book after
book was added to the heap of failures, Miss Murdstone
being firmly watchful of us all the time.
And when we came at last to a question about
five thousand cheeses (canes he made it that day,
I remember), my mother burst out crying.</p>

<p>"Clara!" said Miss Murdstone, in her warning
voice.</p>

<p>"I am not quite well, my dear Jane, I think,"
said my mother.</p>

<p>I saw him wink, solemnly, at his sister, as he
rose and said, taking up the cane:</p>

<p>"Why, Jane, we can hardly expect Clara to bear,
with perfect firmness, the worry and torment
that David has caused her to-day. Clara is
greatly strengthened and improved; but we can
hardly expect so much from her. David, you and
I will go up-stairs, boy."</p>

<p>As he took me out at the door, my mother ran
towards us. Miss Murdstone said, "Clara! are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
you a perfect fool?" and interfered. I saw my
mother stop her ears then, and I heard her crying.</p>

<p>He walked me up to my room slowly and
gravely&mdash;I am certain he had a delight in that
formal show of doing justice&mdash;and when we got
there, suddenly twisted my head under his arm.</p>

<p>"Mr. Murdstone! Sir!" I cried to him.
"Don't! Pray don't beat me! I have tried to
learn, sir, but I can't learn while you and Miss
Murdstone are by. I can't indeed!"</p>

<p>"Can't you, indeed, David?" he said. "We'll
try that."</p>

<p>He had my head as in a vise, but I twined
round him somehow, and stopped him for a
moment, entreating him not to beat me. It was
only for a moment that I stopped him, for he cut
me heavily an instant afterwards, and in the same
instant I caught the hand with which he held me
in my mouth, between my teeth, and bit it through.
It sets my teeth on edge to think of it.</p>

<p>He beat me then, as if he would have beaten me
to death. Above all the noise we made, I heard
them running up the stairs, and crying out&mdash;I
heard my mother crying out&mdash;and Peggotty.
Then he was gone; and the door was locked outside;
and I was lying, fevered, and hot, and torn,
and raging in my puny way, upon the floor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>How well I recollect, when I became quiet,
what an unnatural stillness seemed to reign
through the whole house! How well I remember,
when my smart and passion began to cool, how
wicked I began to feel!</p>

<p>I sat listening for a long while, but there was
not a sound. I crawled up from the floor, and
saw my face in the glass, so swollen, red, and ugly
that it almost frightened me. My stripes were
sore and stiff, and made me cry afresh, when I
moved; but they were nothing to the guilt I felt.
It lay heavier on my breast than if I had been a
most terrible criminal, I dare say, and the longer
I thought of it the greater the offense seemed.</p>

<p>It had begun to grow dark, and I had shut the
window (I had been lying, for the most part, with
my head upon the sill, by turns crying, dozing,
and looking listlessly out), when the key was
turned, and Miss Murdstone came in with some
bread and meat and milk. These she put down
upon the table without a word, glaring at me the
while and then retired, locking the door after
her.</p>

<p>I never shall forget the waking next morning;
the being cheerful and fresh for the first moment,
and then the being weighed down by the stale
and dismal oppression of remembrance. Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Murdstone came again before I was out of bed;
told me, in so many words, that I was free to walk
in the garden for half an hour and no longer;
retired, leaving the door open, that I might avail
myself of that permission.</p>

<p>I did so, and did so every morning of my imprisonment,
which lasted five days. If I could
have seen my mother alone, I should have gone
down on my knees to her and besought her forgiveness;
but I saw no one, Miss Murdstone excepted,
during the whole time.</p>

<p>The length of those five days I can convey no
idea of to anyone. They occupy the place of
years in my remembrance.</p>

<p>On the last night of my restraint, I was awakened
by hearing my own name spoken in a whisper.
I started up in bed, and, putting out my arms in
the dark, said:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Peggotty?"</p>

<p>There was no immediate answer, but presently
I heard my name again, in a tone so very mysterious
and awful, that I think I should have gone
into a fit, if it had not occurred to me that it must
have come through the keyhole.</p>

<p>I groped my way to the door, and, putting my
own lips to the keyhole, whispered:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Peggotty, dear?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, my own precious Davy," she replied.
"Be as soft as a mouse, or the cat'll hear us."</p>

<p>I understood this to mean Miss Murdstone,
and knew that we must be careful and quiet; her
room being close by.</p>

<p>"How's mamma, dear Peggotty? Is she very
angry with me?"</p>

<p>I could hear Peggotty crying softly on her side
of the keyhole, as I was doing on mine, before she
answered. "No. Not very."</p>

<p>"What is going to be done with me, Peggotty,
dear? Do you know?"</p>

<p>"School. Near London," was Peggotty's answer.
I was obliged to get her to repeat it, for
she spoke it the first time quite down my throat
in consequence of my having forgotten to take
my mouth away from the keyhole and put my
ear there; and, though her words tickled me a
good deal, I didn't hear them.</p>

<p>"When, Peggotty?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"Is that the reason why Miss Murdstone took
the clothes out of my drawers?" which she had
done, though I have forgotten to mention it.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peggotty. "Box."</p>

<p>"Shan't I see mamma?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Peggotty. "Morning."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Peggotty fitted her mouth close to the
keyhole, and spoke these words through it with
as much feeling and earnestness as a keyhole has
ever been the means of communicating, I will
venture to say, shooting in each broken little
sentence in a convulsive little burst of its own.</p>

<p>"Davy, dear. If I ain't been azackly as intimate
with you. Lately, as I used to be. It
ain't because I don't love you. Just as well and
more, my pretty poppet. It's because I thought
it better for you. And for someone else besides.
Davy, my darling, are you listening? Can you
hear?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes, Peggotty!" I sobbed.</p>

<p>"My own!" said Peggotty, with infinite compassion.
"What I want to say, is. That you
must never forget me. For I'll never forget you.
And I'll take as much care of your mamma, Davy.
As I ever took of you. And I won't leave her.
The day may come when she'll be glad to lay
her poor head. On her stupid, cross old Peggotty's
arm again. And I'll write to you, my
dear. Though I ain't no scholar. And I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;"
Peggotty fell to kissing the keyhole, as she
couldn't kiss me.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear Peggotty!" said I. "Oh,
thank you! Thank you! Will you promise me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
one thing, Peggotty? Will you write and tell
Mr. Peggotty and little Em'ly and Mrs. Gummidge
and Ham that I am not so bad as they
might suppose, and that I sent 'em all my love&mdash;especially
to little Em'ly? Will you, if you please,
Peggotty?"</p>

<p>The kind soul promised, and we both of us
kissed the keyhole with the greatest affection&mdash;I
patted it with my hand, I recollect, as if it had
been her honest face&mdash;and parted.</p>

<p>In the morning Miss Murdstone appeared as
usual, and told me I was going to school; which
was not altogether such news to me as she supposed.
She also informed me that when I was
dressed, I was to come down-stairs into the parlor
and have my breakfast. There I found my
mother, very pale and with red eyes; into whose
arms I ran, and begged her pardon from my
suffering soul.</p>

<p>"Oh, Davy!" she said. "That you could hurt
anyone I love! Try to be better, pray to be
better! I forgive you; but I am so grieved,
Davy, that you should have such bad passions in
your heart."</p>

<p>Miss Murdstone was good enough to take me out
to the cart, and to say on the way that she hoped
I would repent, before I came to a bad end; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
then I got into the cart, and the lazy horse walked
off with it.</p>

<p>We might have gone about half a mile, and my
pocket handkerchief was quite wet through,
when the carrier stopped short.</p>

<p>Looking out to ascertain for what, I saw, to my
amazement, Peggotty burst from a hedge and
climb into the cart. She took me in both her
arms and squeezed me until the pressure on my
nose was extremely painful, though I never
thought of that till afterwards, when I found it
very tender. Not a single word did Peggotty speak,
releasing one of her arms, she put it down in her
pocket to the elbow, and brought out some paper-bags
of cakes, which she crammed into my pockets,
and a purse which she put into my hand, but not
one word did she say. After another and a final
squeeze with both arms, she got down from the
cart and ran away; and my belief is, and has always
been, without a solitary button on her gown.
I picked up one, of several that was rolling about,
and treasured it as a keepsake for a long time.</p>

<p>The carrier looked at me, as if to inquire if she
were coming back. I shook my head, and said
I thought not. "Then come up!" said the carrier
to the lazy horse, who came up accordingly.</p>

<p>Having by this time cried as much as I possibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
could, I began to think it was of no use crying any
more. The carrier seeing me in this resolution,
proposed that my pocket handkerchief should
be spread upon the horse's back to dry. I
thanked him and agreed; and particularly small
it looked under those circumstances.</p>

<p>I had now time to examine the purse. It was a
stiff leather purse, with a snap, and had three
bright shillings in it, which Peggotty had evidently
polished up with whitening, for my greater delight.
But its precious contents were two half-crowns
folded together in a bit of paper, on which
was written, in my mother's hand, "For Davy.
With my love." I was so overcome by this,
that I asked the carrier to be so good as reach
me my pocket handkerchief again, but he said
he thought I had better do without it; and I
thought I really had; so I wiped my eyes on my
sleeve and stopped myself.</p>

<p>For good, too; though, in consequence of my
previous feelings, I was still occasionally seized
with a stormy sob. After we had jogged on for
some little time, I asked the carrier if he was going
all the way.</p>

<p>"All the way where?" inquired the carrier.</p>

<p>"There," I said.</p>

<p>"Where's there?" inquired the carrier.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Near London," I said.</p>

<p>"Why, that horse," said the carrier, jerking the
rein to point him out, "would be deader than pork
afore he got over half the ground."</p>

<p>"Are you only going to Yarmouth then?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"That's about it," said the carrier. "And there
I shall take you to the stage-cutch, and the stage-cutch
that'll take you to&mdash;wherever it is."</p>

<p>I shared my cakes with the carrier, who asked
if Peggotty made them, and told him yes, she did
all our cooking. The carrier looked thoughtful,
and then asked if I would send a message to Peggotty
from him. I agreed, and the message was
"Barkis is willing." While I was waiting for the
coach at Yarmouth, I wrote to Peggotty:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Peggotty:</span>&mdash;I have come here safe.
Barkis is willing. My love to mamma. Yours
affectionately.</p>

<p>"<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;He says he particularly wanted you to
know <i>Barkis is willing</i>."</p>

<p>At Yarmouth I found dinner was ordered for
me, and felt very shy at having a table all to myself,
and very much alarmed when the waiter told
me he had seen a gentleman fall down dead after
drinking some of their beer. I said I would have
some water, and was quite grateful to the waiter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
for drinking the ale that had been ordered for me,
for fear the people of the hotel should be offended.
He also helped me to eat my dinner, and accepted
one of my bright shillings.</p>

<p>After a long, tiring journey by the coach, for
there were no trains in those days, I arrived in
London and was taken to the school at Blackheath,
by one of the masters, Mr. Mell.</p>

<p>I gazed upon the schoolroom into which he took
me, as the most forlorn and desolate place I had
ever seen. I see it now. A long room, with three
long rows of desks, and six of long seats, bristling
all round with pegs for hats and slates. Scraps
of old copy-books and exercises litter the dirty
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. Mell having left me for a few moments, I
went softly to the upper end of the room, observing
all this as I crept along. Suddenly I came
upon a pasteboard placard, beautifully written
which was lying on the desk, and bore these
words&mdash;"<i>Take care of him.</i> <i>He bites.</i>"</p>

<p>I got upon the desk immediately, afraid of at
least a great dog underneath. But, though I
looked all round with anxious eyes, I could see
nothing of him. I was still engaged in peering
about when Mr. Mell came back, and asked me
what I did up there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir," says I, "if you please,
I'm looking for the dog."</p>

<p>"Dog?" says he. "What dog?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it a dog, sir?"</p>

<p>"Isn't what a dog?"</p>

<p>"That's to be taken care of, sir; that bites."</p>

<p>"No, Copperfield," says he, gravely, "that's not
a dog. That's a boy. My instructions are,
Copperfield, to put this placard on your back.
I am sorry to make such a beginning with you,
but I must do it."</p>

<p>With that, he took me down, and tied the placard,
which was neatly constructed for the purpose,
on my shoulders like a knapsack; and
wherever I went, afterwards, I had the consolation
of carrying it.</p>

<p>What I suffered from that placard, nobody
can imagine. Whether it was possible for people
to see me or not, I always fancied that somebody
was reading it. It was no relief to turn round and
find nobody; for wherever my back was, there I
imagined somebody always to be.</p>

<p>There was an old door in this playground, on
which the boys had a custom of carving their
names. It was completely covered with such
inscriptions. In my dread of the end of the vacation
and their coming back, I could not read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
one boy's name, without inquiring in what tone
and with what emphasis <i>he</i> would read, "Take
care of him. He bites." There was one boy&mdash;a
certain J. Steerforth&mdash;who cut his name very
deep and very often, who, I conceived, would read
it in a rather strong voice, and afterwards pull my
hair. There was another boy, one Tommy Traddles,
who I dreaded would make game of it, and
pretend to be dreadfully frightened of me. There
was a third, George Demple, who I fancied would
sing it. I have looked, a little shrinking creature,
at that door, until the owners of all the names&mdash;there
were five-and-forty of them in the school
then, Mr. Mell said&mdash;seemed to cry out, each in
his own way, "Take care of him. He bites!"</p>

<p>Tommy Traddles was the first boy who returned.
He introduced himself by informing me
that I should find his name on the right-hand
corner of the gate, over the top bolt; upon that
I said, "Traddles?" to which he replied, "The
same," and then he asked me for a full account of
myself and family.</p>

<p>It was fortunate for me that Traddles came
back first. He enjoyed my placard so much that
he saved me from the embarrassment of either
telling about it or trying to hide it by presenting
me to every other boy who came back, great or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
small, immediately on his arrival, in this form
of introduction, "Look here! Here's a game!"
Happily, too, the greater part of the boys came
back low-spirited, and were not so boisterous at
my expense as I had expected. Some of them
certainly could not resist the temptation of pretending
that I was a dog, and patting and smoothing
me lest I should bite, and saying, "Lie down,
sir!" and calling me Towzer. This was naturally
confusing, among so many strangers, and cost some
tears, but on the whole it was much better than
I had anticipated.</p>

<p>I was not considered as being formally received
into the school, however, until J. Steerforth arrived.
Before this boy, who was reputed to be
a great scholar, and was very good-looking, and at
least half-a-dozen years older than I, I was carried
as before a judge. He inquired, under a shed in
the playground, into the particulars of my punishment,
and was pleased to express his opinion that
it was a "jolly shame;" for which I became bound
to him ever afterwards.</p>

<p>"What money have you got, Copperfield?"
he said, walking aside with me when he had disposed
of my affair in these terms.</p>

<p>I told him seven shillings.</p>

<p>"You had better give it to me to take care of,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
he said. "At least, you can, if you like. You
needn't if you don't like."</p>

<p>I hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion,
and, opening Peggotty's purse, turned
it upside down into his hand.</p>

<p>"Do you want to spend anything now?" he
asked me.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," I replied.</p>

<p>"You can, if you like, you know," said Steerforth.
"Say the word."</p>

<p>"No, thank you, sir," I repeated.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you'd like to spend a couple of shillings
or so in a bottle of currant wine by-and-by,
up in the bedroom?" said Steerforth. "You
belong to my bedroom, I find."</p>

<p>It certainly had not occurred to me before, but
I said, Yes, I should like that.</p>

<p>"Very good," said Steerforth. "You'll be glad
to spend another shilling or so in almond cakes,
I dare say?"</p>

<p>I said, "Yes, I should like that, too."</p>

<p>"And another shilling or so in biscuits, and another
in fruit, eh?" said Steerforth. "I say,
young Copperfield, you're going it!"</p>

<p>I smiled because he smiled, but I was a little
troubled in my mind, too.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Steerforth. "We must make it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
stretch as far as we can; that's all. I'll do the
best in my power for you. I can go out when I
like, and I'll smuggle the prog in." With these
words he put the money in his pocket, and kindly
told me not to make myself uneasy; he would take
care it should be all right.</p>

<p>He was as good as his word, if that were all
right which I had a secret misgiving was nearly
all wrong&mdash;for I feared it was a waste of my
mother's two half-crowns&mdash;though I had preserved
the piece of paper they were wrapped in;
which was a precious saving. When we went up-stairs
to bed, he produced the whole seven shillings
worth, and laid it out on my bed in the moonlight,
saying:</p>

<p>"There you are, young Copperfield, and a royal
spread you've got!"</p>

<p>I couldn't think of doing the honors of the feast
at my time of life, while he was by; my hand
shook at the very thought of it. I begged him
to do me the favor of taking charge of the treat;
and my request being seconded by the other boys
who were in that room, he agreed to it, and sat
upon my pillow, handing round the food&mdash;with
perfect fairness, I must say&mdash;and giving out the
currant wine in a little glass without a foot,
which was his own property. As to me, I sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
on his left hand, and the rest were grouped about
us, on the nearest beds and on the floor.</p>

<p>How well I recollect our sitting there, talking
in whispers; or their talking, and my respectfully
listening, I ought rather to say; the moonlight
falling a little way into the room, through the
window, painting a pale window on the floor, and
the greater part of us in shadow, except when
Steerforth scratched a match, when he wanted to
look for anything on the board, and shed a blue
glare over us that was gone directly! A certain
mysterious feeling, consequent on the darkness,
the secrecy of the revel, and the whisper in which
everything was said, steals over me again, and I
listen to all they tell me, with a vague feeling of
solemnity and awe, which makes me glad they are
all so near, and frightens me (though I feign to
laugh) when Traddles pretends to see a ghost in
the corner.</p>

<p>I heard all kinds of things about the school
and all belonging to it. I heard that Mr. Creakle
was the sternest and most severe of masters;
that he laid about him, right and left, every day
of his life, charging in among the boys like a
trooper, and slashing away, unmercifully.</p>

<p>I heard that the man with the wooden leg,
whose name was Tungay, was an obstinate fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
who had formerly been in the hop business, but
had come into the line with Mr. Creakle, in consequence,
as was supposed among the boys, of his
having broken his leg in Mr. Creakle's service, and
having done a deal of dishonest work for him, and
knowing his secrets.</p>

<p>But the greatest wonder that I heard of Mr.
Creakle was, there being one boy in the school on
whom he never ventured to lay a hand, and that
that boy being J. Steerforth. Steerforth himself
confirmed this when it was stated, and said that he
should like to begin to see him do it. On being
asked by a mild boy (not me) how he would proceed
if he did begin to see him do it, he
scratched a match on purpose to shed a glare over
his reply, and said he would commence with knocking
him down with a blow on the forehead from the
seven-and-six-penny ink-bottle that was always
on the mantelpiece. We sat in the dark for some
time, breathless.</p>

<p>I heard that Miss Creakle was regarded by the
school in general as being in love with Steerforth;
and I am sure, as I sat in the dark, thinking of
his nice voice, and his fine face, and his easy
manner, and his curling hair, I thought it very
likely. I heard that Mr. Mell was not a bad sort
of fellow, but hadn't a sixpence to bless himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
with; and that there was no doubt that old Mrs.
Mell, his mother, was as poor as Job.</p>

<p>One day, Traddles (the most unfortunate boy
in the world) breaks a window accidentally with a
ball. I shudder at this moment with the tremendous
sensation of seeing it done, and feeling
that the ball has bounded on to Mr. Creakle's
sacred head.</p>

<p>Poor Traddles! In a tight sky-blue suit that
made his arms and legs like German sausages, or
roly-poly puddings, he was the merriest and most
miserable of all the boys. He was always being
caned&mdash;I think he was caned every day that half-year,
except one holiday Monday, when he was
only rulered on both hands&mdash;and was always
going to write to his uncle about it, and never did.
After laying his head on the desk for a little while,
he would cheer up somehow, begin to laugh again,
and draw skeletons all over his slate before his
eyes were dry. I used at first to wonder what
comfort Traddles found in drawing skeletons.
But I believe he only did it because they were
easy, and didn't want any features.</p>

<p>He was very honorable, Traddles was; and held
it as a solemn duty in the boys to stand by one
another. He suffered for this on several occasions;
and particularly once, when Steerforth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
laughed in church, and the beadle thought it was
Traddles, and took him out. I see him now,
going away under guard, despised by the congregation.
He never said who was the real
offender, though he smarted for it next day, and
was imprisoned so many hours that he came forth
with a whole churchyard full of skeletons swarming
all over his Latin Dictionary. But he had his
reward. Steerforth said there was nothing of the
sneak in Traddles, and we all felt that to be the
highest praise. For my part, I could have gone
through a great deal (though I was much less
brave than Traddles, and nothing like so old) to
have won such a reward, as praise from J. Steerforth.</p>

<p>To see Steerforth walk to church before us,
arm-in-arm with Miss Creakle, was one of the
great sights of my life. I didn't think Miss
Creakle equal to little Em'ly in point of beauty,
and I didn't love her (I didn't dare); but I thought
her a young lady of extraordinary attractions,
and in point of gentility not to be surpassed.
When Steerforth, in white trousers, carried her
parasol for her, I felt proud to know him; and
believed that she could not choose but adore him
with all her heart. Mr. Sharp and Mr. Mell <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'were were'">were</ins>
both great personages in my eyes; but Steerforth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
was to them what the sun was to two stars.
An accidental matter strengthened the friendship
between Steerforth and me, in a manner that
inspired me with great pride and satisfaction,
though it sometimes led to inconvenience. It
happened on one occasion, when he was doing me
the honor of talking to me in the playground
that I remarked that something or somebody&mdash;I
forget what now&mdash;was like something or somebody
in the story of Peregrine Pickle. He said nothing
at the time; but when I was going to bed at night,
asked me if I had got that book.</p>

<p>I told him no, and explained how it was that I
had read it, and all those other books of which I
had made mention.</p>

<p>"And do you recollect them?" Steerforth said.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," I replied; I had a good memory, and
I believed I recollected them very well.</p>

<p>"Then I tell you what, young Copperfield," said
Steerforth, "you shall tell 'em to me. I can't get
to sleep very early at night, and I generally wake
rather early in the morning. We'll go over 'em
one after another. We'll make some regular
Arabian Nights of it."</p>

<p>I felt extremely flattered by this arrangement,
and we commenced carrying out the plan that very
evening.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Steerforth showed his thought for me in one
particular instance, in an unflinching manner that
was a little troublesome, to poor Traddles and the
rest. Peggotty's promised letter&mdash;what a comfortable
letter it was!&mdash;arrived before "the half"
of the school-term was many weeks old; and with
it a cake in a perfect nest of oranges, and two
bottles of cowslip wine. This treasure, as in duty
bound, I laid at the feet of Steerforth, and begged
him to divide it among the boys.</p>

<p>"Now, I'll tell you what, young Copperfield,"
said he, "the wine shall be kept to wet your whistle
when you are story-telling."</p>

<p>I blushed at the idea, and begged him, in my
modesty, not to think of it. But he said he had
observed I was sometimes hoarse&mdash;a little roopy
was his exact expression&mdash;and it should be, every
drop, set apart to the purpose he had mentioned.
Accordingly, it was locked up in his box, and
drawn off by himself in a phial, and administered
to me through a piece of quill in the cork, when I
was supposed to be in want of something to restore
my voice. Sometimes, to make it more
powerful, he was so kind as to squeeze orange
juice into it, or to stir it up with ginger, or dissolve
a peppermint drop in it.</p>

<p>We seem to me to have been months over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Peregrine, and months more over the other stories.
The school never flagged for want of a story, I am
certain; and the wine lasted out almost as well
as the matter. Poor Traddles&mdash;I never think of
that boy but with a strange disposition to laugh,
and with tears in my eyes&mdash;was a sort of echo
to the story; and pretended to be overcome with
laughing at the funny parts, and to be overcome
with fear when there was any passage of an alarming
character in the story. This rather put me out
very often. It was a great jest of his, I recollect,
to pretend that he couldn't keep his teeth from
chattering, whenever mention was made of an
Alguazil in connection with the adventures of
Gil Blas; and I remember when Gil Blas met the
captain of the robbers in Madrid, this unlucky
joker acted such a shudder of terror that he was
overheard by Mr. Creakle, who was prowling about
the passage, and handsomely flogged for disorderly
conduct in the bedroom.</p>

<p>One day I had a visit from Mr. Peggotty and
Ham, who had brought two enormous lobsters,
a huge crab, and a large canvas bag of shrimps,
as they "remembered I was partial to a relish
with my meals."</p>

<p>I was proud to introduce my friend Steerforth
to these kind, simple friends, and told them how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
good Steerforth was to me, and how he helped
me with my work and took care of me, and Steerforth
delighted the fishermen with his friendly,
pleasant manners.</p>

<p>The "relish" was greatly enjoyed by the boys
at supper that night. Only poor Traddles became
very ill from eating crab so late.</p>

<p>At last the holidays came, and I went home.
The carrier, Barkis, met me at Yarmouth, and
was rather gruff, which I soon found out was because
he had not had any answer to his message.
I promised to ask Peggotty for one.</p>

<p>Ah, what a strange feeling it was to be going
home when it was not home, and to find that every
object I looked at reminded me of the happy old
home, which was like a dream I could never dream
again!</p>

<p>God knows how like a child the memory may
have been that was awakened within me by the
sound of my mother's voice in the old parlor, when
I set foot in the hall.</p>

<p>I believed, from the solitary and thoughtful
way in which my mother murmured her song,
that she was alone. And I went softly into the
room. She was sitting by the fire, nursing an
infant, whose tiny hand she held against her neck.
Her eyes were looking down upon its face, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
she sat singing to it. I was so far right, that she
had no other companion.</p>

<p>I spoke to her, and she started, and cried out.
But seeing me, she called me her dear Davy, her
own boy; and, coming half across the room to
meet me, kneeled down upon the ground and
kissed me, and laid my head down on her bosom
near the little creature that was nestling there,
and put its hand up to my lips.</p>

<p>I wish I had died. I wish I had died then, with
that feeling in my heart! I should have been more
fit for heaven than I ever have been since.</p>

<p>"He is your brother," said my mother, fondling
me. "Davy, my pretty boy: my poor child!"
Then she kissed me more and more, and clasped
me round the neck. This she was doing when
Peggotty came running in, and bounced down
on the ground beside us and went mad about us
both for a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>We had a very happy afternoon the day I
came. Mr. and Miss Murdstone were out, and I
sat with my mother and Peggotty, and told them
all about my school and Steerforth, and took the
little baby in my arms and nursed it lovingly.
But when the Murdstones came back I was more
unhappy than ever.</p>

<p>I felt uncomfortable about going down to breakfast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
in The morning, as I had never set eyes on Mr.
Murdstone since the day when I committed my
memorable offense. However, as it must be done,
I went down, after two or three false starts halfway,
and as many runs back on tiptoe to my own
room, and presented myself in the parlor.</p>

<p>He was standing before the fire with his back
to it, while Miss Murdstone made the tea. He
looked at me steadily as I entered, but made no
sign of recognition whatever.</p>

<p>I went up to him, after a moment of confusion,
and said, "I beg your pardon, sir. I am very sorry
for what I did, and I hope you will forgive me."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you are sorry, David," he
replied.</p>

<p>"How do you do, ma'am?" I said to Miss
Murdstone.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear me!" sighed Miss Murdstone, giving
me the tea-caddy scoop instead of her finger.
"How long are the holidays?"</p>

<p>"A month, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Counting from when?"</p>

<p>"From to-day, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Miss Murdstone. "Then here's <i>one</i>
day off."</p>

<p>She kept a calendar of the holidays in this way,
and every morning checked a day off in exactly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the same manner. She did it gloomily until she
came to ten, but when she got into two figures she
became more hopeful, and, as the time advanced,
even jocular.</p>

<p>Thus the holidays lagged away, until the morning
came when Miss Murdstone said: "Here's the
last day off!" and gave me the closing cup of tea
of the vacation.</p>

<p>I was not sorry to go. Again Mr. Barkis appeared
at the gate, and again Miss Murdstone in
her warning voice said: "Clara!" when my mother
bent over me, to bid me farewell.</p>

<p>I kissed her and my baby brother; it is not so
much the embrace she gave me that lives in my
mind, though it was as fervent as could be, as
what followed the embrace.</p>

<p>I was in the carrier's cart when I heard her
calling to me. I looked out, and she stood at the
garden gate alone, holding her baby up in her
arms for me to see. It was cold, still weather;
and not a hair of her head, or fold of her dress, was
stirred, as she looked intently at me, holding up
her child.</p>

<p>So I lost her. So I saw her afterwards in my
sleep at school&mdash;a silent presence near my bed&mdash;looking
at me with the same intent face&mdash;holding
up her baby in her arms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>About two months after I had been back at
school I was sent for one day to go into the parlor.
I hurried in joyfully, for it was my birthday, and
I thought it might be a box from Peggotty&mdash;but,
alas! no; it was very sad news Mrs. Creakle had
to give me&mdash;my dear mamma had died! Mrs.
Creakle was very kind and gentle to me, and the
boys, especially Traddles, were very sorry for me.</p>

<p>I went home the next day, and heard that the
dear baby had died too. Peggotty received me
with great tenderness, and told me about my
mother's illness and how she had sent a loving
message to me.</p>

<p>"Tell my dearest boy that his mother, as she
lay here, blessed him not once, but a thousand
times," and she had prayed to God to protect and
keep her fatherless boy.</p>

<p>Mr. Murdstone did not take any notice of me,
nor had Miss Murdstone a word of kindness for
me. Peggotty was to leave in a month, and, to
my great joy, I was allowed to go with her on a
visit to Mr. Peggotty. On our way I found out
that the mysterious message I had given to Peggotty
meant that Barkis wanted to marry her,
and Peggotty had consented. Everyone in Mr.
Peggotty's cottage was pleased to see me, and did
their best to comfort me. Little Em'ly was at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
school when I arrived, and I went out to meet her.
I knew the way by which she would come, and
presently found myself strolling along the path to
meet her.</p>

<p>A figure appeared in the distance before long,
and I soon knew it to be Em'ly, who was a little
creature still in stature, though she was grown.
But when she drew nearer, and I saw her blue eyes
looking bluer, and her dimpled face looking
brighter, and her own self prettier and gayer, a
curious feeling came over me that made me pretend
not to know her, and pass by as if I were
looking at something a long way off. I have done
such a thing since in later life, or I am mistaken.</p>

<p>Little Em'ly didn't care a bit. She saw me
well enough; but instead of turning round and
calling after me, ran away laughing. This obliged
me to run after her, and she ran so fast that we
were very near the cottage before I caught her.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, is it?" said little Em'ly.</p>

<p>"Why, you knew who it was, Em'ly," said I.</p>

<p>"And didn't <i>you</i> know who it was?" said Em'ly.
I was going to kiss her, but she covered her cherry
lips with her hands, and said she wasn't a baby
now, and ran away, laughing more than ever, into
the house.</p>

<p>She seemed to delight in teasing me, which was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a change in her I wondered at very much. The
tea-table was ready, and our little locker was put
out in its old place, but instead of coming to sit
by me, she went and bestowed her company upon
that grumbling Mrs. Gummidge; and on Mr.
Peggotty's inquiring why, rumpled her hair all
over her face to hide it, and would do nothing
but laugh.</p>

<p>"A little puss it is!" said Mr. Peggotty, patting
her with his great hand.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Peggotty, running his fingers through
her bright curls, "here's another orphan, you see,
sir, and here," giving Ham a backhanded knock
in the chest, "is another of 'em, though he don't
look much like it."</p>

<p>"If I had <i>you</i> for a guardian, Mr. Peggotty,"
said I, "I don't think I should <i>feel</i> much like it."</p>

<p>Em'ly was confused by our all observing her,
and hung down her head, and her face was covered
with blushes. Glancing up presently through
her stray curls, and seeing that we were all looking
at her still (I am sure I, for one, could have looked
at her for hours), she ran away, and kept away
till it was nearly bedtime.</p>

<p>I lay down in the old little bed in the stern of
the boat, and the wind came moaning on across
the flat as it had done before. But I could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
help fancying, now that it moaned, of those who
were gone; and instead of thinking that the sea
might rise in the night and float the boat away,
I thought of the sea that had risen, since I last
heard those sounds, and drowned my happy
home, I recollect, as the wind and water began
to sound fainter in my ears, putting a short clause
into my prayers, petitioning that I might grow
up to marry little Em'ly, and so dropping lovingly
asleep.</p>

<p>During this visit Peggotty was married to Mr.
Barkis, and had a nice little house of her own, and
I spent the night before I was to return home in a
little room in the roof.</p>

<p>"Young or old, Davy dear, so long as I have
this house over my head," said Peggotty, "you
shall find it as if I expected you here directly
every minute. I shall keep it as I used to keep
your old little room, my darling, and if you was
to go to China, you might think of its being kept
just the same all the time you were away."</p>

<p>I felt how good and true a friend she was, and
thanked her as well as I could, for they had
brought me to the gate of my home, and Peggotty
had me clasped in her arms.</p>

<p>I was poor and lonely at home, with no one near
to speak a loving word, or a face to look on with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
love or liking, only the two persons who had
broken my mother's heart. How utterly wretched
and forlorn I felt! I found I was not to go back
to school any more, and wandered about sad and
solitary, neglected and uncared for. Peggotty's
weekly visits were my only comfort. I longed to
go to school, however hard an one, to be taught
something anyhow, anywhere&mdash;but no one took
any pains with me, and I had no friends near who
could help me.</p>

<p>At last one day, after some weary months had
passed, Mr. Murdstone told me I was to go to
London and earn my own living. There was a
place for me at Murdstone &amp; Grinby's, a firm in
the wine trade. My lodging and clothes would be
provided for me by my step-father, and I would
earn enough for my food and pocket money.
The next day, I was sent up to London with the
manager, dressed in a shabby little white hat with
black crape round it for my mother, a black
jacket, and hard, stiff corduroy trousers, a little
fellow of ten years old, to fight my own battles
with the world!</p>

<p>My place, I found, was one of the lowest in the
firm of Murdstone &amp; Grinby, with boys of no education
and in quite an inferior station to myself&mdash;my
duties were to wash the bottles, stick on labels,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and so on. I was utterly miserable at being
degraded in this way, when I thought of my
former companions, Steerforth and Traddles, and
my hopes of becoming a learned and famous man,
and shed bitter tears, as I feared I would forget
all I had learnt at school. My lodging, one bare
little room, was in the house of some people
named Micawber, shiftless, careless, good-natured
people, who were always in debt and difficulties.
I felt great pity for their misfortunes and did what
I could to help poor Mrs. Micawber to sell her
books and other little things she could spare, to
buy food for herself, her husband, and their four
children. I was too young and childish to know
how to provide properly for myself, and often
found I was obliged to live on bread and slices of
cold pudding at the end of the week. If I had
not been a very innocent-minded, good little boy,
I might easily have fallen into bad ways at this
time. But God took care of me and kept me from
harm. I would not even tell Peggotty how miserable
I was, for fear of distressing her.</p>

<p>The troubles of the Micawbers increased more
and more, until at last they were obliged to leave
London. I was very sad at this, for I had been
with them so long that I felt they were my friends,
and the prospect of being once more utterly alone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and having to find a lodging with strangers, made
me so unhappy that I determined to endure this
sort of life no longer. The last Sunday the Micawbers
were in town I dined with them. I had
bought a spotted horse for their little boy and a
doll for the little girl, and had saved up a shilling
for the poor servant-girl. After I had seen them
off the next morning by the coach, I wrote to
Peggotty to ask her if she knew where my aunt,
Miss Betsy Trotwood, lived, and to borrow half-a-guinea;
for I had resolved to run away from
Murdstone &amp; Grinby's, and go to this aunt and tell
her my story. I remembered my mother telling
me of her visit when I was a baby, and that she
fancied Miss Betsy had stroked her hair gently,
and this gave me courage to appeal to her. Peggotty
wrote, enclosing the half-guinea, and saying
she only knew Miss Trotwood lived near Dover,
but whether in that place itself, or at Folkestone,
Sandgate, or Hythe, she could not tell. Hearing
that all these places were close together, I made
up my mind to start. As I had received my
week's wages in advance, I waited till the following
Saturday, thinking it would not be honest to
go before. I went out to look for someone to
carry my box to the coach office, and unfortunately
hired a wicked young man who not only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
ran off with the box, but robbed me of my half-guinea,
leaving me in dire distress. In despair,
I started off to walk to Dover, and was forced to
sell my waistcoat to buy some bread. The first
night I found my way to my old school at Blackheath,
and slept on a haystack close by, feeling
some comfort in the thought of the boys being
near. I knew Steerforth had left, or I would have
tried to see him.</p>

<p>On I trudged the next day and sold my jacket
at Chatham to a dreadful old man, who kept me
waiting all day for the money, which was only
one shilling and fourpence. I was afraid to buy
anything but bread or to spend any money on a
bed or a shelter for the night, and was terribly
frightened by some rough tramps, who threw
stones at me when I did not answer to their calls.
After six days, I arrived at Dover, ragged, dusty,
and half-dead with hunger and fatigue. But
here, at first, I could get no tidings of my aunt,
and, in despair, was going to try some of the other
places Peggotty had mentioned, when the driver
of a fly dropped his horsecloth, and as I was
handing it up to him, I saw something kind in the
man's face that encouraged me to ask once more
if he knew where Miss Trotwood lived.</p>

<p>The man directed me towards some houses on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the heights, and thither I toiled. Going into a
little shop, I by chance met with Miss Trotwood's
maid, who showed me the house, and went in
leaving me standing at the gate, a forlorn little
creature, without a jacket or waistcoat, my white
hat crushed out of shape, my shoes worn out, my
shirt and trousers torn and stained, my pretty
curly hair tangled, my face and hands sunburnt
and covered with dust. Lifting my eyes to one of
the windows above, I saw a pleasant-faced gentleman
with gray hair, who nodded at me several
times, then shook his head and went away. I
was just turning away to think what I should do,
when a tall, erect elderly lady, with a gardening
apron on and a knife in her hand, came out of the
house, and began to dig up a root in the garden.</p>

<p>"Go away," she said. "Go away. No boys
here."</p>

<p>But I felt desperate. Going in softly, I stood
beside her, and touched her with my finger, and
said timidly, "If you please, ma'am&mdash;" and when
she looked up, I went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please, aunt, I am your nephew."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" she exclaimed in astonishment,
and sat flat down on the path, staring at me,
while I went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am David Copperfield of Blunderstone, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Suffolk, where you came the night I was born,
and saw my dear mamma. I have been very
unhappy since she died. I have been neglected
and taught nothing, and thrown upon myself,
and put to work not fit for me. It made me run
away to you. I was robbed at first starting out
and have walked all the way, and have never slept
in a bed since I began the journey." Here I
broke into a passion of crying, and my aunt
jumped up and took me into the house, where she
opened a cupboard and took out some bottles,
pouring some of the contents of each into my
mouth, not noticing in her agitation what they
were, for I fancied I tasted anise-seed water,
anchovy sauce, and salad dressing! Then she
put me on the sofa and sent the servant to ask
"Mr. Dick" to come down. The gentleman whom
I had seen at the window came in and was told
by Miss Trotwood who the ragged little object on
the sofa was, and she finished by saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now here you see young David Copperfield,
and the question is what shall I do with him?"</p>

<p>"Do with him?" answered Mr. Dick. Then,
after some consideration, and looking at me, he
said, "Well, if I was you, I should wash him!"</p>

<p>Miss Trotwood was quite pleased at this, and
a warm bath was got ready at once, after which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
I was dressed in a shirt and trousers belonging
to Mr. Dick (for Janet had burnt my rags), rolled
up in several shawls, and put on the sofa till
dinner-time, where I slept, and woke with the
impression that my aunt had come and put my
hair off my face, and murmured, "Pretty fellow,
poor fellow."</p>

<p>After dinner I had to tell my story all over again
to my aunt and Mr. Dick. Miss Trotwood again
asked Mr. Dick's advice, and was delighted when
that gentleman suggested I should be put to bed.
I knelt down to say my prayers that night in a
pleasant room facing the sea, and as I lay in the
clean, snow-white bed, I felt so grateful and
comforted that I prayed earnestly I might never
be homeless again, and might never forget the
homeless.</p>

<p>The next morning my aunt told me she had
written to Mr. Murdstone. I was alarmed to
think that my step-father knew where I was, and
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know what I shall do if I have to
go back to Mr. Murdstone!"</p>

<p>But my aunt said nothing of her intentions, and
I was uncertain what was to become of me. I
hoped she might befriend me.</p>

<p>At last Mr. and Miss Murdstone arrived. To<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Miss Betsy's great indignation, Miss Murdstone
rode a donkey across the green in front of the
house, and stopped at the gate. Nothing made
Miss Trotwood so angry as to see donkeys on that
green, and I had already seen several battles
between my aunt or Janet and the donkey boys.</p>

<p>After driving away the donkey and the boy
who had dared to bring it there, Miss Trotwood
received her visitors. She kept me near her,
fenced in with a chair.</p>

<p>Mr. Murdstone told Miss Betsy that I was a
very bad, stubborn, violent-tempered boy, whom
he had tried to improve, but could not succeed;
that he had put me in a respectable business from
which I had run away. If Miss Trotwood chose
to protect and encourage me now, she must do it
always, for he had come to fetch me away from
there and then, and if I was ready to come, and
Miss Trotwood did not wish to give me up to be
dealt with exactly as Mr. Murdstone liked, he
would cast me off for always, and have no more
to do with me.</p>

<p>"Are you ready to go, David?" asked my aunt.</p>

<p>But I answered no, and begged and prayed
her for my father's sake to befriend and protect
me, for neither Mr. nor Miss Murdstone had ever
liked me or been kind to me and had made my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
mamma, who always loved me dearly, very unhappy
about me, and I had been very miserable.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dick," said Miss Trotwood, "what shall
I do with this child?"</p>

<p>Mr. Dick considered. "Have him measured
for a suit of clothes directly."</p>

<p>"Mr. Dick," said Miss Trotwood, "your common sense
is invaluable."</p>

<p>Then she pulled me towards her, and said to
Mr. Murdstone, "You can go when you like. I'll
take my chance with the boy. If he's all you say
he is I can at least do as much for him as you have
done. But I don't believe a word of it."</p>

<p>Then she told Mr. Murdstone what she thought
of the way he had treated me and my mother,
which did not make that gentleman feel very
comfortable, and finished by turning to Miss
Murdstone and saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-day to you, too, ma'am, and if I ever
see you ride a donkey across my green again, as
sure as you have a head upon your shoulders,
I'll knock your bonnet off and tread upon it!"</p>

<p>This startled Miss Murdstone so much that she
went off quite quietly with her brother, while I,
overjoyed, threw my arms round my aunt's neck,
and kissed and thanked her with great heartiness.</p>

<p>Some clothes were bought for me that same day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and marked "Trotwood Copperfield," for my
aunt wished to call me by her name.</p>

<p>Now I felt my troubles were over, and I began
quite a new life, well cared for and kindly treated.
I was sent to a very nice school in Canterbury,
where my aunt left me with these words, which I
never forgot:</p>

<p>"Trot, be a credit to yourself, to me, and Mr.
Dick, and heaven be with you. Never be mean
in anything, never be false, never be cruel.
Avoid these three vices, Trot, and I shall always
be hopeful of you?"</p>

<p>I did my best to show my gratitude to my dear
aunt by studying hard, and trying to be all she
could wish.</p>

<p>When you are older you can read how Little
David Copperfield grew up to be a good, clever
man, and met again all his old friends, and made
many new ones.</p>

<p>Also, what became of Steerforth, Traddles, the
Peggottys, little Em'ly, and the Micawbers.</p>

<h3>JENNY WREN.</h3>


<div class='cap'>WALKING into the city one holiday, a
great many years ago, a gentleman ran
up the steps of a tall house in the neighborhood
of St. Mary Axe. The lower windows
were those of a counting-house but the blinds, like
those of the entire front of the house, were drawn
down.</div>

<p>The gentleman knocked and rang several times
before any one came, but at last an old man
opened the door. "What were you up to that
you did not hear me?" said Mr. Fledgeby
irritably.</p>

<p>"I was taking the air at the top of the house,
sir," said the old man meekly, "it being a holiday.
What might you please to want, sir?"</p>

<p>"Humph! Holiday indeed," grumbled his
master, who was a toy merchant amongst other
things. He then seated himself in the counting-house
and gave the old man&mdash;a Jew and Riah by
name&mdash;directions about the dressing of some
dolls about which he had come to speak, and, as
he rose to go, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 319px;">
<img src="images/illus-196.jpg" width="319" height="500" alt="&quot;Seated on the Crystal Carpet Were Two Girls.&quot;   Page 179" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Seated on the Crystal Carpet Were Two Girls.&quot;</span>   <div class='pageref'><a href="#Page_179">Page 179</a></div>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"By-the-by, how <i>do</i> you take the air? Do you
stick your head out of a chimney-pot?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I have made a little garden on the
leads."</p>

<p>"Let's look it at," said Mr. Fledgeby.</p>

<p>"Sir, I have company there," returned Riah
hesitating, "but will you please come up and see
them?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fledgeby nodded, and, passing his master
with a bow, the old man led the way up flight
after flight of stairs, till they arrived at the house-top.
Seated on a carpet, and leaning against a
chimney-stack, were two girls bending over books.
Some humble creepers were trained round the
chimney-pots, and evergreens were placed round
the roof, and a few more books, a basket of gaily
colored scraps, and bits of tinsel, and another of
common print stuff lay near. One of the girls
rose on seeing that Riah had brought a visitor,
but the other remarked, "I'm the person of the
house down-stairs, but I can't get up, whoever
you are, because my back is bad and my legs are
queer."</p>

<p>"This is my master," said Riah, speaking to the
two girls, "and this," he added, turning to Mr.
Fledgeby, "is Miss Jenny Wren; she lives in this
house, and is a clever little dressmaker for little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
people. Her friend Lizzie," continued Riah,
introducing the second girl. "They are good
girls, both, and as busy as they are good; in
spare moments they come up here and take to
book learning."</p>

<p>"We are glad to come up here for rest, sir,"
said Lizzie, with a grateful look at the old Jew.
"No one can tell the rest what this place is to us."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Mr. Fledgeby, looking round,
"Humph!" He was so much surprised that
apparently he couldn't get beyond that word, and
as he went down again the old chimney-pots in
their black cowls seemed to turn round and look
after him as if they were saying "Humph" too.</p>

<p>Lizzie, the elder of these two girls, was strong
and handsome, but little Jenny Wren, whom she
so loved and protected, was small and deformed,
though she had a beautiful little face, and the
longest and loveliest golden hair in the world,
which fell about her like a cloak of shining curls,
as though to hide the poor little mis-shapen
figure.</p>

<p>The Jew Riah, as well as Lizzie, was always
kind and gentle to Jenny Wren, who called him her
godfather. She had a father, who shared her
poor little rooms, whom she called her child; for
he was a bad, drunken, worthless old man, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the poor girl had to care for him, and earn money
to keep them both. She suffered a great deal,
for the poor little bent back always ached sadly,
and was often weary from constant work but it
was only on rare occasions, when alone or with
her friend Lizzie, who often brought her work and
sat in Jenny's room, that the brave child ever
complained of her hard lot. Sometimes the two
girls Jenny helping herself along with a crutch,
would go and walk about the fashionable streets,
in order to note how the grand folks were dressed.
As they walked along, Jenny would tell her friend
of the fancies she had when sitting alone at her
work. "I imagine birds till I can hear them sing,"
she said one day, "and flowers till I can smell
them. And oh! the beautiful children that come
to me in the early mornings! They are quite
different to other children, not like me, never cold,
or anxious, or tired, or hungry, never any pain;
they come in numbers, in long bright slanting
rows, all dressed in white, and with shiny heads.
'Who is this in pain?' they say, and they sweep
around and about me, take me up in their arms,
and I feel so light, and all the pain goes. I know
when they are coming a long way off, by hearing
them say, 'Who is this in pain?' and I answer,
'Oh my blessed children, it's poor me! have pity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
on me, and take me up and then the pain will
go."</p>

<p>Lizzie sat stroking and brushing the beautiful
hair, whilst the tired little dressmaker leant
against her when they were at home again, and as
she kissed her good-night, a miserable old man
stumbled into the room. "How's my Jenny
Wren, best of children?" he mumbled, as he
shuffled unsteadily towards her, but Jenny pointed
her small finger towards him, exclaiming&mdash;"Go
along with you, you bad, wicked old child, you
troublesome, wicked old thing, <i>I</i> know where you
have been, <i>I</i> know your tricks and your manners."
The wretched man began to whimper like a
scolded child. "Slave, slave, slave, from morning
to night," went on Jenny, still shaking her
finger at him, "and all for this; ain't you ashamed
of yourself, you disgraceful boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes; my dear, yes," stammered the tipsy old
father, tumbling into a corner. Thus was the
poor little dolls' dressmaker dragged down day
by day by the very hands that should have cared
for and held her up; poor, poor little dolls' dressmaker!
One day when Jenny was on her way
home with Riah, who had accompanied her on
one of her walks to the West End, they came on a
small crowd of people. A tipsy man had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
knocked down and badly hurt. "Let us see what
it is!" said Jenny, coming swiftly forward on her
crutches. The next moment she exclaimed&mdash;"Oh,
gentlemen&mdash;gentlemen, he is my child, he
belongs to me, my poor, bad old child!"</p>

<p>"Your child&mdash;belongs to you," repeated the
man who was about to lift the helpless figure on
to a stretcher, which had been brought for the
purpose. "Aye, it's old Dolls&mdash;tipsy old Dolls,"
cried someone in the crowd, for it was by this
name that they knew the old man.</p>

<p>"He's her father, sir," said Riah in a low tone
to the doctor who was now bending over the
stretcher.</p>

<p>"So much the worse," answered the doctor,
"for the man is dead."</p>

<p>Yes, "Mr. Dolls" was dead, and many were the
dresses which the weary fingers of the sorrowful
little worker must make in order to pay for his
humble funeral and buy a black frock for herself.
Riah sat by her in her poor room, saying a word
of comfort now and then, and Lizzie came and
went, and did all manner of little things to help
her; but often the tears rolled down on to her
work. "My poor child," she said to Riah, "my
poor old child, and to think I scolded him so."</p>

<p>"You were always a good, brave, patient girl,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
returned Riah, smiling a little over her quaint
fancy about her <i>child</i>, "always good and patient,
however tired."</p>

<p>And so the poor little "person of the house"
was left alone but for the faithful affection of the
kind Jew and her friend Lizzie. Her room grew
pretty and comfortable, for she was in great
request in her "profession," as she called it, and
there were now no one to spend and waste her
earnings. But nothing could make her life
otherwise than a suffering one till the happy
morning when her child-angels visited her for the
last time and carried her away to the land where
all such pain as hers is healed for evermore.</p>

<h3>PIP'S ADVENTURE</h3>


<div class="figright" style="width: 328px;">
<img src="images/illus-204.jpg" width="328" height="500" alt="&quot;Keep Still, You Little Imp, or I&#39;ll Cut Your Throat.&quot;   Page 185" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Keep Still, You Little Imp, or I&#39;ll Cut Your Throat.&quot;</span>   <div class='pageref'><a href="#Page_185">Page 185</a></div>
</div><div class='cap'>ALL that little Philip Pirrip, usually called
Pip, knew about his father and mother,
and his five little brothers, was from seeing
their tombstones in the churchyard. He was
cared for by his sister, who was twenty years older
than himself. She had married a blacksmith,
named Joe Gargery, a kind, good man, while she,
unfortunately, was a hard, stern woman, and
treated her little brother and her amiable husband
with great harshness. They lived in a marshy
part of the country, about twenty miles from the
sea.</div>

<p>One cold, raw day towards evening, when Pip
was about six years old, he had wandered into the
churchyard, and was trying to make out what he
could of the inscriptions on his family tombstones.
The darkness was coming on, and feeling very
lonely and frightened, he began to cry.</p>

<p>"Hold your noise!" cried a terrible voice; and
a man started up from among the graves close to
him. "Keep still, you little imp, or I'll cut your
throat!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a dreadful looking man, dressed in
coarse gray cloth, with a great iron on his leg.
Wet, muddy, and miserable, he limped and
shivered, and glared and growled; his teeth
chattered in his head, as he seized Pip, by the chin.</p>

<p>"Oh! don't cut my throat, sir," cried Pip, in
terror. "Pray don't do it, sir."</p>

<p>"Tell us your name!" said the man. "Quick!"</p>

<p>"Pip, sir."</p>

<p>"Once more," said the man, staring at him,
"Give it mouth."</p>

<p>"Pip. Pip, sir."</p>

<p>"Show us where you live," said the man.
"Point out the place."</p>

<p>Pip showed him the village, about a mile or
more from the church.</p>

<p>The man looked at him for a moment, and then
turned him upside down and emptied his pockets.
He found nothing in them but a piece of bread,
which he ate ravenously.</p>

<p>"You young dog," said the man, licking his
lips, "what fat cheeks you ha' got.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Darn me if I couldn't eat 'em, and if I han't half
a mind to!"</p>

<p>Pip said earnestly that he hoped he would not.</p>

<p>"Now lookee here," said the man. "Where's
your mother?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"There sir," said Pip.</p>

<p>At this the man started and seemed about to
run away, but stopped and looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"There, sir," explained Pip, showing him the
tombstone.</p>

<p>"Oh, and is that your father along of your
mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Pip.</p>

<p>"Ha!" muttered the man, "then who d'ye live
with&mdash;supposin' you're kindly let to live, which I
han't made up my mind about?"</p>

<p>"My sister, sir, Mrs. Joe Gargery, wife of Joe
Gargery, the blacksmith, sir."</p>

<p>"Blacksmith, eh?" said the man, and looked
down at his leg. Then he seized the trembling
little boy by both arms, and glaring down at him,
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now lookee here, the question being whether
you're to be let to live. You know what a file is?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And you know what wittles is. Something
to eat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You get me a file, and you get me wittles&mdash;you
bring 'em both to me." All this time he was
tilting poor Pip backwards till he was so dreadfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
frightened and giddy that he clung to the
man with both hands.</p>

<p>"You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that
file and them wittles. You do it, and you never
dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning
your having seen such a person as me, or
any person sumever, and you shall be let to live."
Then he threatened all sorts of dreadful and terrible
things to poor Pip if he failed to do all he had
commanded, and made him solemnly promise to
bring him what he wanted, and to keep the secret.
Then he let him go, saying, "You remember what
you've undertook, and you get home."</p>

<p>"Goo&mdash;good-night, sir," faltered Pip.</p>

<p>"Much of that!" said he, glancing over the cold
wet flat. "I wish I was a frog or a eel!"</p>

<p>Pip ran home without stopping. Joe was sitting
in the chimney-corner, and told him Mrs. Joe
had been out to look for him, and taken Tickler
with her. Tickler was a cane, and Pip was rather
downhearted by this piece of news.</p>

<p>Mrs. Joe came in almost directly, and, after
having given Pip a taste of Tickler, she sat down to
prepare the tea, and, cutting a huge slice of bread
and butter, she gave half of it to Joe and half to
Pip. Pip managed, after some time, to slip his
down the leg of his trousers, and Joe, thinking he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
had swallowed it, was dreadfully alarmed and
begged him not to bolt his food like that. "Pip,
old chap, you'll do yourself a mischief&mdash;it'll stick
somewhere, you can't have chewed it, Pip. You
know, Pip, you and me is always friends and I'd
be the last one to tell upon you any time, but
such a&mdash;such a most uncommon bolt as that."</p>

<p>"Been bolting his food, has he?" cried Mrs. Joe.</p>

<p>"You know, old chap," said Joe. "I bolted
myself when I was your age&mdash;frequent&mdash;and as a
boy I've been among a many bolters; but I
never see your bolting equal yet, Pip, and it's a
mercy you ain't bolted dead."</p>

<p>Mrs. Joe made a dive at Pip, fished him up by
the hair, saying, "You come along and be dosed."</p>

<p>It was Christmas eve, and Pip had to stir the
pudding from seven to eight, and found the bread
and butter dreadfully in his way. At last he
slipped out and put it away in his little bedroom.</p>

<p>Poor Pip passed a wretched night, thinking of
the dreadful promise he had made, and as soon as
it was beginning to get light outside he got up
and crept down-stairs, fancying that every board
creaked out "Stop thief!" and "Get up, Mrs. Joe!"</p>

<p>As quickly as he could, he took some bread,
some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mince-meat,
which he tied up in a handkerchief, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the slice of bread and butter, some brandy from
a stone bottle, a meat-bone with very little on it,
and a pork-pipe, which he found on an upper shelf.
Then he got a file from among Joe's tools, and ran
for the marshes.</p>

<p>It was a very misty morning, and Pip imagined
that all the cattle stared at him, as if to say,
"Halloa, young thief!" and one black ox with a
white cravat on, that made Pip think of a clergyman,
looked so accusingly at him, that Pip blubbered
out, "I couldn't help it, sir! It wasn't for
myself I took it."</p>

<p>Upon which the ox put down his head, blew a
cloud of smoke out of his nose, and vanished with
a kick-up of his hind legs and a flourish of his
tail.</p>

<p>Pip was soon at the place of meeting after that,
and there was the man&mdash;hugging himself and limping
to and fro, as if he had never all night left
off hugging and limping. He was awfully cold,
to be sure. Pip half expected to see him drop
down before his face and die of cold. His eyes
looked so awfully hungry, too, that when Pip
handed him the file it occurred to him he would
have tried to eat it, if he had not seen the bundle.
He did not turn Pip upside down, this time, to get
at what he had, but left him right side upward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
while he opened the bundle and emptied his
pockets.</p>

<p>"What's in the bottle, boy?" said he.</p>

<p>"Brandy," said Pip.</p>

<p>He was already handing mince-pie down his
throat in the most curious manner, more like a
man who was putting it away somewhere in a
violent hurry than a man who was eating it&mdash;but
he left off to take some of the liquor, shivering
all the while so violently that it was quite as
much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle
between his teeth.</p>

<p>"I think you have got the chills," said Pip.</p>

<p>"I'm much of your opinion, boy," said he.</p>

<p>"It's bad about here. You've been lying out
on the marshes, and they're dreadful for the chills.
Rheumatic, too."</p>

<p>"I'll eat my breakfast before they're the death
of me," said he. "I'd do that, if I was going to
be strung up to that there gallows as there is over
there directly arterward. I'll beat the shivers
so far, I'll bet you a guinea."</p>

<p>He was gobbling mince-meat, meat-bone, bread,
cheese, and pork-pie all at once, staring distrustfully
while he did so at the mist all round, and
often stopping&mdash;even stopping his jaws&mdash;to listen.
Some real or fancied sound, some clink upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
river or breathing of beasts upon the marsh, now
gave him a start, and he said, suddenly:</p>

<p>"You're not a false imp? You brought no one
with you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir! No!"</p>

<p>"Nor told nobody to follow you?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I believe you. You'd be but
a fierce young hound indeed, if at your time of
life you should help to hunt a wretched warmint,
hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor
wretched warmint is!"</p>

<p>Something clicked in his throat, as if he had
works in him like a clock, and was going to strike.
And he smeared his ragged, rough sleeve over his
eyes.</p>

<p>Pitying his desolation, and watching him as he
gradually settled down upon the pie, Pip made
bold to say, "I am glad you enjoy it."</p>

<p>"Did you speak?"</p>

<p>"I said I was glad you enjoyed it."</p>

<p>"Thankee, my boy&mdash;. I do."</p>

<p>Pip had often watched a large dog eating his
food; and he now noticed a decided similarity
between the dog's way of eating and the man's.
The man took strong, sharp, sudden bites, just like
the dog. He swallowed, or rather snapped up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
every mouthful too soon and too fast; and he
looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if
he thought there was danger of somebody's
coming to take the pie away. He was altogether
too unsettled in his mind over it to enjoy it comfortably,
Pip thought, or to have anybody to
dine with him, without making a chop with his
jaws at the visitor. In all of which particulars
he was very like the dog.</p>

<p>Pip watched him trying to file the iron off his
leg, and then being afraid of stopping longer away
from home, he ran off.</p>

<p>Pip passed a wretched morning, expecting every
moment that the disappearance of the pie would
be found out. But Mrs. Joe was too much taken
up with preparing the dinner, for they were expecting
visitors, and were to have a superb dinner,
consisting of a leg of pickled pork and greens, and
a pair of roast stuffed fowls, a mince-pie, and a
pudding.</p>

<p>Just at the end of the dinner Pip thought his
time had come to be found out, for his sister said
graciously to her guests&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must taste a most delightful and delicious
present I have had. It's a pie, a savory pork-pie."</p>

<p>Pip could bear it no longer, and ran for the door,
and there ran head foremost into a party of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out
a pair of handcuffs to him, saying, "Here you are,
look sharp, come on." But they had not come
for him, they only wanted Joe to mend the handcuffs,
for they were on the search for two convicts
who had escaped and were somewhere hid in the
marshes. This turned the attention of Mrs. Joe
from the disappearance of the pie, without which
she had come back, in great astonishment.
When the handcuffs were mended the soldiers
went off, accompanied by Joe and one of the visitors,
and Joe took Pip and carried him on his
back.</p>

<p>Pip whispered, "I hope, Joe, we shan't find
them," and Joe answered, "I'd give a shilling if
they had cut and run, Pip."</p>

<p>But the soldiers soon caught them, and one was
the wretched man who had talked with Pip; and
once when he looked at Pip, the child shook his
head to try and let him know he had said nothing.</p>

<p>But the convict, without looking at anyone,
told the sergeant he wanted to say something to
prevent other people being under suspicion, and
said he had taken some "wittles" from the blacksmith's.
"It was some broken wittles, that's
what it was, and a dram of liquor, and a
pie."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you happened to miss such an article
as a pie, blacksmith?" inquired the sergeant.</p>

<p>"My wife did, at the very moment when you
came in. Don't you know, Pip?"</p>

<p>"So," said the convict, looking at Joe, "you're
the blacksmith, are you? Then, I'm sorry to
say, I've eat your pie."</p>

<p>"God knows you're welcome to it," said Joe.
"We don't know what you have done, but we
wouldn't have you starved to death for it, poor
miserable fellow-creature. Would us, Pip?"</p>

<p>Then the boat came, and the convicts were
taken back to their prison, and Joe carried Pip
home.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Some years after, some mysterious friend sent
money for Pip to be educated and brought up as a
gentleman; but it was only when Pip was quite
grown up that he discovered this mysterious
friend was the wretched convict who had frightened
him so dreadfully that cold, dark Christmas eve.
He had been sent to a far away land, and there had
grown rich; but he never forgot the little boy who
had been kind to him.</p>

<h2>X.</h2>

<h3>TODGERS'.</h3>


<div class='cap'>THIS is the story of a visit made by Mr.
Pecksniff, a very pompous man, and his two
daughters Miss Mercy and Miss Charity,
to the boarding-house kept by Mrs. Todgers, in
London; and a call while there on Miss Pinch, a
governess or young lady teaching in a rich family.</div>

<p>Mr. Pecksniff with his two beautiful young
daughters looked about him for a moment, and
then knocked at the door of a very dingy building,
even among the choice collection of dingy houses
around, on the front of which was a little oval
board, like a tea-tray, with this inscription&mdash;"Commercial
Boarding-house: M. Todgers."</p>

<p>It seemed that M. Todgers was not up yet,
for Mr. Pecksniff knocked twice and rang three
times without making any impression on anything
but a dog over the way. At last a chain and some
bolts were withdrawn with a rusty noise, and a
small boy with a large red head, and no nose to
speak of, and a very dirty boot on his left arm,
appeared; who (being surprised) rubbed the nose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
just mentioned with the back of a shoe-brush, and
said nothing.</p>

<p>"Still abed, my man?" asked Mr. Pecksniff.</p>

<p>"Still abed!" replied the boy. "I wish they
was still abed. They're very noisy abed; all
calling for their boots at once. I thought you was
the paper, and wondered why you didn't shove
yourself <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'though'">through</ins>  the grating as usual. What do
you want?"</p>

<p>Considering his years, which were tender, the
youth may be said to have asked this question
sternly, and in something of a defiant manner.
But Mr. Pecksniff, without taking offense at his
bearing, put a card in his hand, and bade him take
that up-stairs, and show them in the meanwhile
into a room where there was a fire.</p>

<p>Surely there never was, in any other borough,
city, or hamlet, in the world, such a singular
sort of a place as Todgers'. And surely London,
to judge from that part of it which hemmed
Todgers' round, and hustled it, and crushed it,
and stuck its brick-and-mortar elbows into it, and
kept the air from it, and stood perpetually between
it and the light, was worthy of Todgers'.</p>

<p>There were more trucks near Todgers' than you
would suppose a whole city could ever need; not
trucks at work but a vagabond race, forever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
lounging in the narrow lanes before their masters'
doors and stopping up the pass; so that when
a stray hackney-coach or lumbering wagon came
that way, they were the cause of such an uproar
as enlivened the whole neighborhood, and made
the very bells in the next church-tower ring again.
In the narrow dark streets near Todgers', wine-merchants
and wholesale dealers in grocery-ware
had perfect little towns of their own; and, deep
among the very foundations of these buildings,
the ground was undermined and burrowed out
into stables, where cart-horses, troubled by rats,
might be heard on a quiet Sunday, rattling their
halters, as disturbed spirits in tales of haunted
houses are said to clank their chains.</p>

<p>To tell of half the queer old taverns that had a
drowsy and secret existence near Todgers' would
fill a goodly book; while a second volume no less
in size might be given to an account of the quaint
old guests who frequented their dimly-lighted
parlors.</p>

<p>The top of the house was worthy of notice.
There was a sort of terrace on the roof, with posts
and fragments of rotten lines, once intended to
dry clothes upon; and there were two or three
tea-chests out there, full of earth, with forgotten
plants in them, like old walking-sticks. Whoever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
climbed to this observatory was stunned at first
from having knocked his head against the little
door in coming out; and, after that, was for the
moment choked from having looked, perforce,
straight down the kitchen chimney; but these two
stages over, there were things to gaze at from the
top of Todgers', well worth your seeing, too. For,
first and foremost, if the day were bright, you
observed upon the house-tops, stretching far
away, a long dark path&mdash;the shadow of the tall
Monument which stands in memory of the great
fire in London many years before: and turning
round, the Monument itself was close beside you,
with every hair erect upon his golden head, as if
the doings of the city frightened him. Then
there were steeples, towers, belfries, shining
vanes and masts of ships, a very forest. Gables,
house-tops, garret-windows, wilderness upon wilderness.
Smoke and noise enough for all the
world at once.</p>

<p>After the first glance, there were slight features
in the midst of this crowd of objects, which sprung
out from the mass without any reason, as it were,
and took hold of the attention whether the spectator
would or no. Thus, the revolving chimney-pots
on one great stack of buildings seemed to be
turning gravely to each other every now and then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and whispering the result of their separate observation
of what was going on below. Others, of a
crooked-back shape, appeared to be maliciously
holding themselves askew, that they might shut
the prospect out and baffle Todgers'. The man
who was mending a pen at an upper window over
the way became of vast importance in the scene,
and made a blank in it, ridiculously large in its
size, when he went away. The fluttering of a
piece of cloth upon the dyer's pole had far more
interest for the moment than all the changing
motion of the crowd. Yet even while the looker-on
felt angry with himself for this, and wondered
how it was the tumult swelled into a roar; the
hosts of objects seemed to thicken and expand a
hundredfold; and after gazing round him, quite
scared, he turned into Todgers' again, much more
rapidly than he came out; and ten to one he told
M. Todgers afterwards that if he hadn't done so,
he would certainly have come into the street by
the shortest cut: that is to say, head-foremost.</p>

<p>So said the two Miss Pecksniffs, when they came
down with Mrs. Todgers from the roof of the house;
leaving the youthful porter to close the door and
follow them down-stairs: who being of a playful
temperament, and contemplating with a delight
peculiar to his sex and time of life any chance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of dashing himself into small fragments, lingered
behind to walk upon the wall around the roof.</p>

<p>It was the second day of their stay in London,
and by this time the Misses Pecksniff and Mrs.
Todgers were becoming very friendly, insomuch
that the last-named lady had already told the
story of three early disappointments in love; and
had furthermore given her young friends a general
account of the life, conduct, and character of Mr.
Todgers: who, it seemed, had cut his life as a
husband rather short, by unlawfully running
away from his happiness, and staying for a time in
foreign countries as a bachelor.</p>

<p>"Your pa was once a little particular in his
attentions, my dears," said Mrs. Todgers, "but
to be your ma was too much happiness denied me.
You'd hardly know who this was done for, perhaps?"</p>

<p>She called their attention to an oval miniature,
like a little blister, which was tacked up over the
kettle-holder, and in which there was a dreamy
shadowing forth of her own visage.</p>

<p>"It's a speaking likeness!" cried the two Misses
Pecksniff.</p>

<p>"It was considered so once," said Mrs. Todgers,
warming herself in a gentlemanly manner at the
fire: "but I hardly thought you would have
known it, my loves."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>They would have known it anywhere. If they
could have met with it in the street or seen it in a
shop-window, they would have cried, "Good
gracious! Mrs. Todgers!"</p>

<p>"Being in charge of a boarding-house like this
makes sad havoc with the features, my dear Misses
Pecksniff," said Mrs. Todgers. "The gravy alone
is enough to add twenty years to one's age, I do
assure you."</p>

<p>"Lor!" cried the two Misses Pecksniff.</p>

<p>"The anxiety of that one thing, my dears,"
said Mrs. Todgers, "keeps the mind continually
upon the stretch. There is no such passion in
human nature as the passion for gravy among
business men. It's nothing to say a joint won't
yield&mdash;a whole animal wouldn't yield&mdash;the amount
of gravy they expect each day at dinner. And
what I have undergone in consequence," cried
Mrs. Todgers, raising her eyes and shaking her
head, "no one would believe!"</p>

<p>"Just like Mr. Pinch, Mercy!" said Charity.
"We have always noticed it in him, you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear," giggled Mercy, "but we have
never given it him, you know."</p>

<p>Mr. Pecksniff kept what was called a school
for architects, and Tom Pinch was one of his students.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"You, my dears, having to deal with your pa's
pupils who can't help themselves, are able to take
your own way," said Mrs. Todgers, "but in a
boarding-house, where any gentleman may say,
any Saturday evening, 'Mrs. Todgers, this day
week we part, in consequence of the cheese,'
it is not so easy to preserve a pleasant understanding.
Your pa was kind enough," added the good
lady, "to invite me to take a ride with you to-day;
and I think he mentioned that you were going to
call upon Miss Pinch. Any relation to the gentleman
you were speaking of just now, Miss Pecksniff?"</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, Mrs. Todgers," interposed
the lively Mercy, "don't call him a gentleman.
My dear Cherry, Pinch a gentleman! The
idea!"</p>

<p>"What a wicked girl you are!" cried Mrs. Todgers,
embracing her with great affection. "You
are quite a joker, I do declare! My dear Miss
Pecksniff, what a happiness your sister's spirits
must be to your pa and self!"</p>

<p>"That Pinch is the most hideous, goggle-eyed
creature, Mrs. Todgers, in existence," resumed
Mercy: "quite an ogre. The ugliest, awkwardest,
frightfullest being, you can imagine. This
is his sister, so I leave you to suppose what <i>she</i> is.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
I shall be obliged to laugh outright, I know I
shall!" cried the charming girl. "I never shall
be able to keep my face straight. The notion
of a Miss Pinch really living at all is sufficient to
kill one, but to see her&mdash;oh my stars!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Todgers laughed immensely at the dear
love's humor, and declared she was quite afraid of
her, that she was. She was so very severe.</p>

<p>"Who is severe?" cried a voice at the door.
"There is no such thing as severity in our family,
I hope!" And then Mr. Pecksniff peeped smilingly
into the room, and said, "May I come in,
Mrs. Todgers?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Todgers almost screamed, for the little
door between that room and the inner one being
wide open, there was a full showing of the sofa-bedstead
open as a bed, and not closed as a sofa.
But she had the presence of mind to close it in the
twinkling of an eye; and having done so, said,
though not without confusion, "Oh yes, Mr.
Pecksniff, you can come in if you please."</p>

<p>"How are we to-day," said Mr. Pecksniff,
jocosely; "and what are our plans? Are we
ready to go and see Tom Pinch's sister? Ha, ha,
ha! Poor Thomas Pinch!"</p>

<p>"Are we ready," returned Mrs. Todgers, nodding
her head in a mysterious manner, "to send a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
favorable reply to Mr. Jinkins' round-robin?<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
That's the first question, Mr. Pecksniff."</p>

<p>"Why Mr. Jinkins' robin, my dear madam?"
asked Mr. Pecksniff, putting one arm round
Mercy and the other round Mrs. Todgers, whom
he seemed for the moment, to mistake for Charity.
"Why Mr. Jinkins'?"</p>

<p>"Because he began to get it up, and indeed
always takes the lead in the house," said Mrs.
Todgers, playfully. "That's why, sir."</p>

<p>"Jinkins is a man of superior talents," observed
Mr. Pecksniff. "I have formed a great regard for
Jinkins. I take Jinkins' desire to pay polite attention
to my daughters as an additional proof of the
friendly feelings of Jinkins, Mrs. Todgers."</p>

<p>"Well now," returned the lady, "having said
so much, you must say the rest, Mr. Pecksniff: so
tell the dear young ladies all about it."</p>

<p>With these words, she gently drew away from
Mr. Pecksniff's grasp, and took Miss Charity
into her own embrace; though whether she was
led to this act solely by the affection she had conceived
for that young lady, or whether it had any
reference to a lowering, not to say distinctly
spiteful expression which had been visible in her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
face for some moments, has never been exactly
ascertained. Be this as it may, Mr. Pecksniff
went on to inform his daughters of the purpose and
history of the round-robin aforesaid, which was, in
brief, that the young men who helped to make
up the sum and substance of that company, called
Todgers', desired the honor of their presence at
the general table so long as they remained in the
house, and besought that they would grace the
board at dinner-time next day, the same being
Sunday. He further said that, Mrs. Todgers
having consented to this invitation, he was willing,
for his part, to accept it; and so left them that he
might write his gracious answer, the while they
armed themselves with their best bonnets for the
utter defeat and overthrow of Miss Pinch.</p>

<p>Tom Pinch's sister was governess in a family,
a lofty family; perhaps the wealthiest brass and
copper founder's family known to mankind.
They lived at Camberwell; in a house so big and
fierce that its mere outside, like the outside of a
giant's castle, struck terror into vulgar minds
and made bold persons quail. There was a great
front gate, with a great bell, whose handle was in
itself a note of admiration; and a great lodge,
which, being close to the house, rather spoiled
the look-out certainly, but made the look-in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
tremendous. At this entry, a great porter kept
constant watch and ward; and when he gave the
visitor high leave to pass, he rang a second great
bell, answering to whose notes a great footman
appeared in due time at the great hall-door with
such great tags upon his liveried shoulders that
he was perpetually entangling and hooking himself
among the chairs and tables and led a life of
torment which could scarcely have been surpassed
if he had been a blue-bottle in a world of cobwebs.</p>

<p>To this mansion, Mr. Pecksniff, accompanied
by his daughters and Mrs. Todgers, drove gallantly
in a one-horse fly. The foregoing ceremonies
having been all performed, they were ushered
into the house, and so, by degrees, they got at last
into a small room with books in it, where Mr.
Pinch's sister was at that moment instructing her
eldest pupil: to wit, a little woman thirteen years
old, who had already arrived at such a pitch of
whalebone and education that she had nothing
girlish about her; which was a source of great
rejoicing to all her relations and friends.</p>

<p>"Visitors for Miss Pinch!" said the footman.
He must have been an ingenious young man, for
he said it very cleverly; with a nice distinction
in his manner between the cold respect with which
he would have announced visitors to the family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and the warm personal interest with which he
would have announced visitors to the cook.</p>

<p>"Visitors for Miss Pinch!"</p>

<p>Miss Pinch rose hastily with such tokens of
agitation as plainly declared that her list of callers
was not numerous. At the same time, the little
pupil became alarmingly upright, and prepared
herself to take notice of all that might be said and
done. For the lady of the establishment was
curious in the natural history and habits of the
animal called Governess, and encouraged her
daughters to report thereon whenever occasion
served; which was, in reference to all parties concerned,
very proper, improving, and pleasant.</p>

<p>It is a melancholy fact, but it must be related,
that Mr. Pinch's sister was not at all ugly. On
the contrary, she had a good face&mdash;a very mild
and friendly face; and a pretty little figure&mdash;slight
and short, but remarkable for its neatness.
There was something of her brother, much of him
indeed, in a certain gentleness of manner, and in
her look of timid truthfulness; but she was so far
from being a fright, or a dowdy, or a horror, or
anything else predicted by the two Misses Pecksniff,
that those young ladies naturally regarded her
with great indignation, feeling that this was by
no means what they had come to see.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Mercy, as having the larger share of gayety,
bore up the best against this disappointment, and
carried it off, in outward show at least, with a
titter; but her sister, not caring to hide her disdain,
expressed it pretty openly in her looks. As
to Mrs. Todgers, she leaned on Mr. Pecksniff's
arm and preserved a kind of genteel grimness,
suitable to any state of mind, and involving any
shade of opinion.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, Miss Pinch," said Mr.
Pecksniff, taking her hand condescendingly in one
of his, and patting it with the other. "I have
called to see you, in pursuance of a promise given
to your brother, Thomas Pinch. My name&mdash;compose
yourself, Miss Pinch&mdash;is Pecksniff."</p>

<p>The good man spoke these words as though he
would have said, "You see in me, young person,
the friend of your race; the patron of your house;
the preserver of your brother, who is fed with
manna daily from my table; and in right of whom
there is a considerable balance in my favor at
present standing in the books beyond the sky.
But I have no pride, for I can afford to do without
it!"</p>

<p>The poor girl felt it all as if it had been Gospel
Truth. Her brother, writing in the fullness of
his simple heart, had often told her so, and how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
much more! As Mr. Pecksniff ceased to speak,
she hung her head, and dropped a tear upon his
hand.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, Miss Pinch!" thought the sharp
pupil, "crying before strangers as if you didn't
like the situation!"</p>

<p>"Thomas is well," said Mr. Pecksniff; "and
sends his love and this letter. I cannot say, poor
fellow, that he will ever become great in our profession;
but he has the will to do well, which is
the next thing to having the power; and, therefore,
we must bear with him. Eh?"</p>

<p>"I know he has the will, sir," said Tom Pinch's
sister, "and I know how kindly and thoughtfully
you cherish it, for which neither he nor I can ever
be grateful enough, as we often say in writing to
each other. The young ladies, too," she added,
glancing gratefully at his two daughters. "I
know how much we owe to them."</p>

<p>"My dears," said Mr. Pecksniff, turning to them
with a smile: "Thomas' sister is saying something
you will be glad to hear, I think."</p>

<p>"We can't take any merit to ourselves, papa!"
cried Cherry, as they both showed Tom Pinch's
sister, with a courtesy, that they would feel
obliged if she would keep her distance. "Mr.
Pinch's being so well provided for is owing to you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
alone, and we can only say how glad we are to
hear that he is as grateful as he ought to be."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, Miss Pinch!" thought the pupil
again. "Got a grateful brother, living on other
people's kindness!"</p>

<p>"It was very kind of you," said Tom Pinch's
sister, with Tom's own simplicity and Tom's own
smile, "to come here&mdash;very kind indeed: though
how great a kindness you have done me in gratifying
my wish to see you, and to thank you with my
own lips, you, who make so light of benefits conferred,
can scarcely think."</p>

<p>"Very grateful; very pleasant; very proper;"
murmured Mr. Pecksniff.</p>

<p>"It makes me happy too," said Ruth Pinch,
who, now that her first surprise was over, had a
chatty, cheerful way with her, and a single-hearted
desire to look upon the best side of everything,
which was the very moral and image of Tom;
"very happy to think that you will be able to tell
him how more than comfortably I am situated
here, and how unnecessary it is that he should ever
waste a regret on my being cast upon my own
resources. Dear me! So long as I heard that he
was happy and he heard that I was," said Tom's
sister, "we could both bear, without one impatient
or complaining thought, a great deal more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
ever we have had to endure, I am certain." And
if ever the plain truth were spoken on this occasionally
false earth, Tom's sister spoke it when she
said that.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Mr. Pecksniff, whose eyes had in the
meantime wandered to the pupil; "certainly.
And how do <i>you</i> do, my very interesting child?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, I thank you, sir," replied that
frosty innocent.</p>

<p>"A sweet face this, my dears," said Mr. Pecksniff,
turning to his daughters. "A charming
manner!"</p>

<p>Both young ladies had been in delight with the
child of a wealthy house (through whom the
nearest road and shortest cut to her parents
might be supposed to lie) from the first. Mrs.
Todgers vowed that anything one-quarter so
angelic she had never seen. "She wanted but a
pair of wings, a dear," said that good woman, "to
be a young syrup"&mdash;meaning, possibly, young
sylph or seraph.</p>

<p>"If you will give that to your distinguished
parents, my amiable little friend," said Mr. Pecksniff,
producing one of his professional cards,
"and will say that I and my daughters&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Todgers, pa," said Mercy.</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Todgers, of London," added Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Pecksniff, "that I, and my daughters, and Mrs.
Todgers, of London, did not intrude upon them,
as our object simply was to take some notice of
Miss Pinch, whose brother is a young man in my
employment; but that I could not leave this very
noble mansion without adding my humble tribute,
as an architect, to the correctness and elegance
of the owner's taste, and to his just appreciation
of that beautiful art, to the cultivation of which I
have devoted a life, and to the promotion of whose
glory and advancement I have sacrificed a&mdash;a
fortune&mdash;I shall be very much obliged to you."</p>

<p>"Missis' compliments to Miss Pinch," said the
footman, suddenly appearing and speaking in
exactly the same key as before, "and begs to know
wot my young lady is a-learning of just now."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mr. Pecksniff, "here is the young
man. <i>He</i> will take the card. With my compliments,
if you please, young man. My dears, we
are interrupting the studies. Let us go."</p>

<p>One evening, following the visit to Miss Pinch,
there was a great bustle at Todgers', partly owing
to some additional domestic preparations for the
morrow and partly to the excitement always
arising in that house from Saturday night, when
every gentleman's linen arrived at a different
hour in his own little bundle, with his private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
account pinned on the outside. Shrill quarrels
from time to time arose between Mrs. Todgers
and the girls in remote back kitchens; and sounds
were occasionally heard, indicative of small
articles of ironmongery and hardware being
thrown at the boy. It was the custom of that
youth on Saturdays to roll up his shirt sleeves to
his shoulders, and pervade all parts of the house
in an apron of coarse green baize; moreover, he
was more strongly tempted on Saturdays than on
other days (it being a busy time) to make bolts
into the neighboring alleys when he answered
the door, and there to play at leap-frog and other
sports with vagrant lads, until pursued and
brought back by the hair of his head or the lobe
of his ear; thus, he was quite a conspicuous feature
among the peculiar incidents of the last day in
the week at Todgers'.</p>

<p>He was especially so on this particular Saturday
evening, and honored the Misses Pecksniff with
a deal of notice; seldom passing the door of Mrs.
Todgers' private room, where they sat alone before
the fire, without putting in his head and greeting
them with some such compliments as, "There you
are again!" "Ain't it nice?"&mdash;and similar humorous
attentions.</p>

<p>"I say," he whispered, stopping in one of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
journeys to and fro, "young ladies, there's soup
to-morrow. She's a-making it now. Ain't she
a-putting in the water? Oh! not at all neither!"</p>

<p>In the course of answering another knock, he
thrust in his head again:</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;there's fowls to-morrow. Not skinny
ones. Oh no!"</p>

<p>Presently he called through the keyhole:</p>

<p>"There's a fish to-morrow&mdash;just come. Don't
eat none of him!" and with this spectral warning
vanished again.</p>

<p>By-and-by, he returned to lay the cloth for
supper. He entertained them on this occasion
by thrusting the lighted candle into his mouth,
after the performance of which feat, he went on
with his professional duties; brightening every
knife as he laid it on the table, by breathing on the
blade and afterwards polishing the same on the
apron already mentioned. When he had completed
his preparations, he grinned at the sisters,
and expressed his belief that the approaching
meal would be of "rather a spicy sort."</p>

<p>"Will it be long before it's ready, Bailey?"
asked Mercy.</p>

<p>"No," said Bailey, "it <i>is</i> cooked. When I
come up she was dodging among the tender
pieces with a fork, and eating of 'em."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>But he had scarcely achieved the utterance of
these words, when he received a sudden blow on
the head, which sent him staggering against the
wall; and Mrs. Todgers, dish in hand, stood
indignantly before him.</p>

<p>"Oh you little villain!" said that lady. "Oh
you bad, false boy!"</p>

<p>"No worse than yerself," retorted Bailey,
guarding his head with his arm. "Ah! Come
now! Do that agin, will yer!"</p>

<p>"He's the most dreadful child," said Mrs.
Todgers, setting down the dish, "I ever had to
deal with. The gentlemen spoil him to that
extent, and teach him such things, that I'm afraid
nothing but hanging will ever do him any good."</p>

<p>"Won't it!" cried Bailey. "Oh! Yes! Wot
do you go a-lowerin' the table-beer for, then, and
destroying my constitooshun?"</p>

<p>"Go down-stairs, you vicious boy!" said Mrs.
Todgers, holding the door open. "Do you hear
me? Go along!"</p>

<p>After two or three skilful dodges he went, and
was seen no more that night, save once, when he
brought up some tumblers and hot water, and
much disturbed the two Misses Pecksniff by squinting
hideously behind the back of the unconscious
Mrs. Todgers. Having done this justice to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
wounded feelings, he retired under-ground; where,
in company with a swarm of black beetles and a
kitchen candle, he employed himself in cleaning
boots and brushing clothes until the night was
far advanced.</p>

<p>Benjamin was supposed to be the real name of
this young servant, but he was known by a great
variety of names. Benjamin, for instance, had
been converted into Uncle Ben, and that again
had been corrupted into Uncle. The gentlemen
at Todgers' had a merry habit, too, of bestowing
upon him, for the time being, the name of any
notorious criminal or minister; and sometimes,
when current events were flat, they even sought
the pages of history for these distinctions; as Mr.
Pitt, Young Brownrigg, and the like. At the
period of which we write, he was generally known
among the gentlemen as Bailey junior; a name
bestowed upon him in contradistinction, perhaps,
to the Old Bailey prison; and possibly as involving
the recollection of an unfortunate lady of the same
name, who perished by her own hand early in life,
and has been made famous in a song.</p>

<p>The usual Sunday dinner-hour at Todgers' was
two o'clock&mdash;a suitable time, it was considered,
for all parties; convenient to Mrs. Todgers, on
account of the baker's; and convenient to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
gentlemen, with reference to their afternoon
engagements. But on the Sunday which was to
introduce the two Misses Pecksniff to a full knowledge
of Todgers' and its society, the dinner was
postponed until five, in order that everything
might be as genteel as the occasion demanded.</p>

<p>When the hour drew nigh, Bailey junior, testifying
great excitement, appeared in a complete suit
of cast-off clothes several sizes too large for him,
and, in particular, mounted a clean shirt of such
extraordinary magnitude that one of the gentlemen
(remarkable for his ready wit) called him
"collars" on the spot. At about a quarter before
five a deputation, consisting of Mr. Jinkins and
another gentleman whose name was Gander,
knocked at the door of Mrs. Todgers' room, and,
being formally introduced to the two Misses Pecksniff
by their parent, who was in waiting, besought
the honor of showing them up-stairs.</p>

<p>Here the gentlemen were all assembled. There
was a general cry of "Hear, hear!" and "Bravo,
Jink!" when Mr. Jinkins appeared with Charity
on his arm: which became quite rapturous as
Mr. Gander followed, escorting Mercy, and Mr.
Pecksniff brought up the rear with Mrs. Todgers.</p>

<p>"The wittles is up!"</p>

<h2>XI.</h2>

<h3>DICK SWIVELLER AND THE MARCHIONESS.</h3>


<div class='cap'>RICHARD SWIVELLER, a good-hearted,
though somewhat queer young man, the
clerk of Sampson Brass, a scheming lawyer,
often found time hanging heavily on his
hands; and for the better preservation of his
cheerfulness therefore, and to prevent his faculties
from rusting, he provided himself with a cribbage-board
and pack of cards, and accustomed himself
to play at cribbage with a dummy, for twenty,
thirty, or sometimes even fifty thousand pounds
a side, besides many hazardous bets to a considerable
amount.</div>

<p>As these games were very silently conducted,
notwithstanding the greatness of the interests
involved, Mr. Swiveller, began to think that on
those evenings when Mr. and Miss Brass were out
(and they often went out now) he heard a kind of
snorting or hard-breathing sound in the direction
of the door, which it occurred to him, after some
thought, must proceed from the small servant,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
who always had a cold from damp living. Looking
intently that way one night, he plainly distinguished
an eye gleaming and glistening at the
keyhole; and having now no doubt that his
suspicions were correct, he stole softly to the door
and pounced upon her before she was aware of his
approach.</p>

<p>"Oh! I didn't mean any harm indeed. Upon
my word I didn't," cried the small servant, struggling
like a much larger one. "It's so very dull
down-stairs. Please don't you tell upon me;
please don't."</p>

<p>"Tell upon you!" said Dick. "Do you mean to
say you were looking through the keyhole for
company?"</p>

<p>"Yes, upon my word I was," replied the small
servant.</p>

<p>"How long have you been cooling your eye
there?" said Dick.</p>

<p>"Oh, ever since you first began to play them
cards, and long before."</p>

<p>Vague recollections of several fantastic exercises
such as dancing around the room, and bowing
to imaginary people with which he had refreshed
himself after the fatigues of business; all of which,
no doubt, the small servant had seen through the
keyhole, made Mr. Swiveller feel rather awkward;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
but he was not very sensitive on such points, and
recovered himself speedily.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;come in," he said, after a little thought.
"Here&mdash;sit down, and I'll teach you how to play."</p>

<p>"Oh! I durstn't do it," rejoined the small servant.
"Miss Sally 'ud kill me, if she know'd I
came up here."</p>

<p>"Have you got a fire down-stairs?" said Dick.</p>

<p>"A very little one," replied the small servant.</p>

<p>"Miss Sally couldn't kill me if she know'd I
went down there, so I'll come," said Richard,
putting the cards into his pocket. "Why, how
thin you are! What do you mean by it?"</p>

<p>"It ain't my fault."</p>

<p>"Could you eat any bread and meat?" said
Dick, taking down his hat. "Yes? Ah! I
thought so. Did you ever taste beer?"</p>

<p>"I had a sip of it once," said the small servant.</p>

<p>"Here's a state of things!" cried Mr. Swiveller,
raising his eyes to the ceiling. "She <i>never</i> tasted
it&mdash;it can't be tasted in a sip! Why, how old are
you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>Mr. Swiveller opened his eyes very wide and
appeared thoughtful for a moment; then, bidding
the child mind the door until he came back, vanished
straightway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently he returned, followed by the boy from
the public house, who bore in one hand a plate of
bread and beef and in the other a great pot, filled
with some very fragrant compound, which sent
forth a grateful steam, and was indeed choice purl
made after a particular rule which Mr. Swiveller
had given to the landlord at a period when he was
deep in his books and desirous to win his friendship.
Relieving the boy of his burden at the door,
and charging his little companion to fasten it to
prevent surprise, Mr. Swiveller followed her into
the kitchen.</p>

<p>"There!" said Richard, putting the plate before
her. "First of all, clear that off, and then you'll
see what's next."</p>

<p>The small servant needed no second bidding,
and the plate was soon empty.</p>

<p>"Next," said Dick, handing the purl, "take a
pull at that; but moderate your delight, you
know, for you're not used to it. Well, is it
good?"</p>

<p>"Oh! isn't it?" said the small servant.</p>

<p>Mr. Swiveller appeared gratified beyond all
expression by this reply, and took a long draught
himself, steadfastly regarding his companion
while he did so. These matters disposed of, he
applied himself to teaching her the game, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
she soon learnt tolerably well, being both sharp-witted
and cunning.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mr. Swiveller, putting two sixpences
into a saucer, and trimming the wretched
candle, when the cards had been cut and dealt,
"those are the stakes. If you win, you get 'em
all. If I win, I get 'em. To make it seem more
real and pleasant, I shall call you the Marchioness,
do you hear?"</p>

<p>The small servant nodded.</p>

<p>"Marchioness," as the reader knows, is a title
to a lady of very high rank, and such Mr. Swiveller
chose to imagine this small servant to be.</p>

<p>"Then, Marchioness," said Mr. Swiveller, "fire
away!"</p>

<p>The Marchioness, holding her cards very tight
in both hands, considered which to play, and Mr.
Swiveller, assuming the gay and fashionable air
which such society required, took another pull at
the jug and waited for her to lead in the game.</p>

<p>Mr. Swiveller and his partner played several
rubbers with varying success, until the loss of three
sixpences, the gradual sinking of the purl, and the
striking of ten o'clock, combined to render that
gentleman mindful of the flight of time, and the
wisdom of withdrawing before Mr. Sampson and
Miss Sally Brass returned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"With which object in view, Marchioness,"
said Mr. Swiveller gravely, "I shall ask your ladyship's
permission to put the board in my pocket,
and to retire from the presence when I have
finished this glass; merely observing, Marchioness,
that since life like a river is flowing, I care not how
fast it rolls on, ma'am, on, while such purl on the
bank still is growing, and such eyes light the waves
as they run. Marchioness, your health! You will
excuse my wearing my hat but the palace is damp,
and the marble floor is&mdash;if I may be allowed the
expression&mdash;sloppy."</p>

<p>As a protection against this latter inconvenience
Mr. Swiveller had been sitting for some time with
his feet on the hob, in which attitude he now gave
utterance to these apologetic observations, and
slowly sipped the last choice drops of nectar.</p>

<p>"The Baron Sampsono Brasso and his fair sister
are (you tell me) at the Play?" said Mr. Swiveller,
leaning his left arm heavily upon the table, and
raising his voice and his right leg after the manner
of a bandit in the theater.</p>

<p>The Marchioness nodded.</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Mr. Swiveller with a portentous
frown. "'Tis well, Marchioness!&mdash;but no matter.
Some wine there. Ho!" He illustrated these
melodramatic morsels by handing the glass to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
himself with great humility, receiving it haughtily,
drinking from it thirstily, and smacking his lips
fiercely.</p>

<p>The small servant, who was not so well acquainted
with theatrical customs as Mr. Swiveller
(having indeed never seen a play or heard one
spoken of, except by some chance through chinks
of doors and in other forbidden places), was
rather alarmed by demonstrations so strange in
their nature, and showed her concern so plainly
in her looks that Mr. Swiveller felt it necessary to
change his brigand manner for one more suitable
to private life, as he asked:</p>

<p>"Do they often go where glory waits 'em, and
leave you here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I believe they do," returned the
small servant. "Miss Sally's such a one-er for
that, she is."</p>

<p>"Such a what?" said Dick.</p>

<p>"Such a one-er," returned the Marchioness.</p>

<p>After a moment's reflection, Mr. Swiveller
determined to forego his responsible duty of setting
her right and to suffer her to talk on, as it
was evident that her tongue was loosened by the
purl and her opportunities for conversation were
not so frequent as to render a momentary check
of little consequence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"They sometimes go to see Mr. Quilp," said the
small servant with a shrewd look; "they go to a
good many places, bless you."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Brass a wunner?" said Dick.</p>

<p>"Not half what Miss Sally is, he isn't," replied
the small servant, shaking her head. "Bless you,
he'd never do anything without her."</p>

<p>"Oh! He wouldn't, wouldn't he?" said Dick.</p>

<p>"Miss Sally keeps him in such order," said the
small servant; "he always asks her advice, he
does; and he catches it sometimes. Bless you,
you wouldn't believe how much he catches it."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Dick, "that they consult
together a good deal, and talk about a great many
people&mdash;about me, for instance sometimes, eh,
Marchioness?"</p>

<p>The Marchioness nodded amazingly.</p>

<p>"Do they speak of me in a friendly manner?"
said Mr. Swiveller.</p>

<p>The Marchioness changed the motion of her
head, which had not yet left off nodding, and
suddenly began to shake it from side to side so
hard as to threaten breaking her neck.</p>

<p>"Humph!" Dick muttered. "Would it be any
breach of confidence, Marchioness, to relate what
they say of the humble individual who has now
the honor to&mdash;&mdash;?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Sally says you're a funny chap," replied
his friend.</p>

<p>"Well, Marchioness," said Mr. Swiveller, "that's
not uncomplimentary. Merriment, Marchioness,
is not a bad or degrading quality. Old King Cole
was himself a merry old soul, if we may put any
faith in the pages of history."</p>

<p>"But she says," pursued his companion, "that
you ain't to be trusted."</p>

<p>"Why, really, Marchioness," said Mr. Swiveller
thoughtfully; "several ladies and gentlemen&mdash;not
exactly professional persons, but tradespeople,
ma'am, tradespeople&mdash;have made the
same remark. The person who keeps the hotel
over the way inclined strongly to that opinion to-night
when I ordered him to prepare the banquet.
It's a popular prejudice, Marchioness; and yet I
am sure I don't know why, for I have been trusted
in my time to a considerable amount, and I can
safely say that I never forsook my trust until it
deserted me&mdash;never. Mr. Brass is of the same
opinion, I suppose?"</p>

<p>His friend nodded again, with a cunning look
which seemed to hint that Mr. Brass held stronger
opinions on the subject than his sister; and seeming
to recollect herself, added imploringly, "But don't
you ever tell upon me, or I shall be beat to death."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Marchioness," said Mr. Swiveller, rising, "the
word of a gentleman is as good as his bond&mdash;sometimes
better; as in the present case, where
his bond might prove but a doubtful sort of
security. I am your friend, and I hope we shall
play many more rubbers together in the same
saloon. But, Marchioness," added Richard, stopping
on his way to the door, and wheeling slowly
round upon the small servant, who was following
with the candle, "it occurs to me that you must
be in the constant habit of airing your eye at
keyholes, to know all this."</p>

<p>"I only wanted," replied the trembling Marchioness,
"to know where the key of the safe was
hid; that was all; and I wouldn't have taken
much, if I had found it&mdash;only enough to squench
my hunger."</p>

<p>"You didn't find it, then?" said Dick. "But
of course you didn't, or you'd be plumper. Good-night,
Marchioness. Fare thee well, and if forever,
then forever fare thee well&mdash;and put up the chain,
Marchioness, in case of accidents."</p>

<p>With this parting word, Mr. Swiveller came out
from the house; and feeling that he had by this
time taken quite as much to drink as promised to
be good for his constitution (purl being a rather
strong and heady compound), wisely resolved to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
betake himself to his lodgings, and to bed at once.
Homeward he went therefore; and his apartments
(for he still spoke of his one little room as "apartments")
being at no great distance from the office,
he was soon seated in his own bed-chamber, where,
having pulled off one boot and forgotten the
other, he fell into deep thought.</p>

<p>"This Marchioness," said Mr. Swiveller, folding
his arms, "is a very extraordinary person&mdash;surrounded
by mysteries, ignorant of the taste of
beer, unacquainted with her own name (which is
less remarkable), and taking a limited view of
society through the keyholes of doors&mdash;can these
things be her destiny, or has some unknown person
started an opposition to the decrees of fate?
It is a most amazing staggerer!"</p>

<p>When his meditations had attained this satisfactory
point, he became aware of his remaining
boot, of which, with great solemnity, he proceeded
to divest himself; shaking his head with exceeding
gravity all the time, and sighing deeply.</p>

<p>"These rubbers," said Mr. Swiveller, putting on
his nightcap in exactly the same style as he wore
his hat, "remind me of the matrimonial fireside.
My old girl, Chegg's wife, plays cribbage; all-fours
alike. She rings the changes on 'em now.
From sport to sport they hurry her, to banish her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
regrets, and when they win a smile from her, they
think that she forgets&mdash;but she don't. By this
time, I should say," added Richard, getting his
left cheek into profile, and looking complacently
at the reflection of a very little scrap of whisker
in the looking-glass; "by this time, I should say,
the iron has entered into her soul. It serves her
right."</p>

<p>Mr. Swiveller, it must be said had been at one
time somewhat in love with a young lady: but
she had left his love and married a Mr. Cheggs.</p>

<p>Melting from this stern and harsh into the tender
and pathetic mood, Mr. Swiveller groaned a
little, walked wildly up and down, and even made
a show of tearing his hair, which, however, he
thought better of, and wrenched the tassel from
his nightcap instead. At last, undressing himself
with a gloomy resolution, he got into bed.</p>

<p>Some men, in his blighted position, would have
taken to drinking; but as Mr. Swiveller had taken
to that before, he only took, on receiving the news
that this girl was lost to him forever, to playing
the flute; thinking, after mature consideration,
that it was a good, sound, dismal occupation,
not only in unison with his own sad thoughts, but
tending to awaken a fellow-feeling in the bosom,
of his neighbors. Following out this resolution,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
he now drew a little table to his bedside, and,
arranging the light and a small oblong music-book
to the best advantage, took his flute from
its box and began to play most mournfully.</p>

<p>The air was "Away with melancholy"&mdash;a composition,
which, when it is played very slowly on
the flute in bed, with the farther disadvantage of
being performed by a gentleman not fully acquainted
with the instrument, who repeats one
note a great many times before he can find the
next, has not a lively effect. Yet for half the
night, or more, Mr. Swiveller, lying sometimes on
his back with his eyes upon the ceiling and sometimes
half out of bed to correct himself by the
book, played this unhappy tune over and over
again; never leaving off, save for a minute or two
at a time to take breath and talk to himself about
the Marchioness and then beginning again with
renewed vigor. It was not until he had quite
exhausted his several subjects of meditation, and
had breathed into the flute the whole sentiment
of the purl down to its very dregs, and had nearly
maddened the people of the house, and at both the
next doors, and over the way&mdash;that he shut up the

<h3>MR. WARDLE'S SERVANT JOE.</h3>


<div class='cap'>AN old country gentleman named Wardle had
a servant of whom he was very proud, not
because of the latter's diligence, but because
Joe, commonly called the "Fat Boy," was a
character which could not be matched anywhere in
the world. At the time when our story opens, Mr.
Pickwick of London, and three others of his
literary club, were traveling in search of adventure.
With Mr. Pickwick, the founder and head of the
Pickwick club, were Mr. Tupman, whose great
weakness for the ladies brought him frequent
troubles, Mr. Winkle, whose desire to appear as a
sport brought much ridicule upon himself, and
Mr. Snodgrass, whose poetic nature induced him
to write many romantic verses which amused his
friends and all who read them. These four Pickwickians
were introduced one day to Mr. Wardle,
his aged sister Miss Rachel Wardle, and his two
daughters, Emily and Isabella, as they were looking
at some army reviews from their coach. Mr.
Wardle hospitably asked Mr. Pickwick and his
friends to join them in the coach.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></div>

<p>"Come up here! Mr. Pickwick," said Mr.
Wardle, "come along sir. Joe! Drat that boy!
He's gone to sleep again. Joe, let down the steps
and open the carriage door. Come ahead, room
for two of you inside and one outside. Joe, make
room for one. Put this gentleman on the box!"
Mr. Wardle mounted with a little help and the fat
boy, where he was, fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>One rank of soldiers after another passed, firing
over the heads of another rank, and when the
cannon went off the air resounded with the screams
of ladies. Mr. Snodgrass actually found it
necessary to support one of the Misses Wardle
with his arm. Their maidenly aunt was in
such a dreadful state of nervous alarm that
Mr. Tupman found that <i>he</i> was obliged to
put his arm about <i>her</i> waist to keep her up
at all. Everyone was excited with the exception
of the fat boy, and he slept as
soundly as if the roaring of cannon were his
ordinary lullaby.</p>

<p>"Joe! Joe!" called Mr. Wardle. "Drat that
boy! He's gone asleep again. Pinch him in the
leg, if you please. Nothing else wakens him.
Thank you. Get out the lunch, Joe." The fat
boy, who had been effectually aroused by Mr.
Winkle, proceeded to unpack the hamper with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
more quickness than could have been expected
from his previous inactivity.</p>

<p>"Now Joe, knives and forks." The knives and
forks were handed in and each one was furnished
with these useful implements.</p>

<p>"Now Joe, the fowls. Drat that boy! He's
gone asleep again. Joe! Joe!" Numerous taps
on the head with a stick and the fat boy with some
difficulty was awakened. "Go hand in the eatables."
There was something in the sound of the
last word which aroused him. He jumped up
with reddened eyes which twinkled behind his
mountainous cheeks, and feasted upon the food
as he unpacked it from the basket.</p>

<p>"Now make haste," said Mr. Wardle, for the fat
boy was hanging fondly over a chicken which he
seemed wholly unable to part with. The boy
sighed deeply and casting an ardent gaze upon
its plumpness, unwillingly handed it to his
master.</p>

<p>"A very extraordinary boy, that," said Mr.
Pickwick. "Does he always sleep in this way?"</p>

<p>"Sleep!" said the old gentleman. "He's always
sleeping. Goes on errands fast asleep and snores
as he waits at table."</p>

<p>"How very odd," said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>"Ah! odd indeed," returned the old gentleman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
"I'm proud of that boy. Wouldn't part with him
on any account. He's a natural curiosity. Here,
Joe, take these things away and open another
bottle. Do you hear?" The fat boy aroused,
opened his eyes, started and finished the piece of
pie he was in the act of eating when he fell fast
asleep, and slowly obeyed his master's orders,
looking intently upon the remains of the feast as he
removed the plates and stowed them in the hamper.
At last Mr. Wardle and his party mounted
the coach and prepared to drive off.</p>

<p>"Now mind," he said, as he shook hands with
Mr. Pickwick, "we expect to see you all to-morrow.
You have the address?"</p>

<p>"Manor Farm, Dingley Dell," said Mr. Pickwick,
consulting his pocket-book.</p>

<p>"That's it," said the old gentleman. "You
must come for at least a week. If you are traveling
to get country life, come to me and I will give
you plenty of it. Joe! Drat that boy, he's gone
to sleep again. Help put in the horses." The
horses were put in and the driver mounted and the
boy clambered up by his side. The farewells were
exchanged and the carriage rolled off. As the
Pickwickians turned around to take a last glimpse
of it the setting sun cast a red gold upon the faces
of their entertainers, and fell upon the form of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
fat boy. His head was sunk upon his bosom, and
he slumbered again.</p>

<p>After some amusing difficulties, which we have
not space to describe here, Mr. Pickwick and his
friends arrived safely at the country home of Mr.
Wardle. The time passed very pleasantly.</p>

<p>One day some of the men decided upon a shooting
trip, and Mr. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Wardle'">Winkle</ins> , to maintain his reputation
as a sport, did not admit that he knew nothing
about guns. Mr. Pickwick, early in the morning,
seeing Mr. Wardle carrying a gun, asked what
they were going to do.</p>

<p>"Why, your friend and I are going out rook
shooting. He's a very good shot, isn't he?" said
Mr. Wardle.</p>

<p>"I have heard him say he's a capital one,"
replied Mr. Pickwick, "but I never saw him aim at
anything."</p>

<p>"Well," said the host, "I wish Mr. Tupman
would join us. Joe! Joe!" The fat boy who,
under the exciting influences of the morning, did
not appear to be more than three parts and a
fraction asleep, emerged from the house. "Go
up and call Mr. Tupman, and tell him he will find
us waiting." At last the party started, Mr. Tupman
having joined them. Some boys, who were
with them, discovered a tree with a nest in one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the branches, and when all was ready Mr. Wardle
was persuaded to shoot first. The boys shouted,
and shook a branch with a nest on it, and a half-a-dozen
young rooks, in violent conversation, flew
out to ask what the matter was. Mr. Wardle
leveled his gun and fired; down fell one and off
flew the others.</p>

<p>"Pick him up, Joe," said the old gentleman.
There was a smile upon the youth's face as he
advanced, for an indistinct vision of rook pie
floated through his imagination. He laughed as
he retired with the bird. It was a plump one.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Winkle," said the host, reloading
his own gun, "fire away." Mr. Winkle advanced
and raised his gun. Mr. Pickwick and his friends
crouched involuntarily to escape damage from
the heavy fall of birds which they felt quite certain
would be caused by their friend's skill. There
was a solemn pause, a shout, a flapping of wings.</p>

<p>Mr. Winkle closed his eyes and fired; there was
a scream from an individual, not a rook. Mr.
Tupman had saved the lives of innumerable birds
by receiving a portion of the charge in his left arm.
Though it was a very slight wound, Mr. Tupman
made a great fuss about it and everyone was
horror-stricken. He was partly carried to the
house. The unmarried aunt uttered a piercing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
scream, burst into an hysterical laugh and fell
backwards into the arms of her nieces. She
recovered, screamed again, laughed again and
fainted again.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself," said Mr. Tupman, affected
almost to tears by this expression of sympathy.
"Dear, dear Madam, calm yourself."</p>

<p>"You are not dead?" exclaimed the hysterical
lady. "Say you are not dead!"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Rachel," said Mr. Winkle.
"What the mischief is the use of his saying he
isn't dead?"</p>

<p>"No! No! I am not," said Mr. Tupman. "I
require no assistance but yours. Let me lean on
your arm," he added in a whisper. Miss Rachel
advanced and offered her arm. They turned into
the breakfast parlor. Mr. Tupman gently pressed
her hands to his lips and sunk upon the sofa.
Presently the others left him to her tender mercies.
That afternoon Mr. Tupman, much affected by the
extreme tenderness of Miss Rachel, suggested
that as he was feeling much better they take a
short stroll in the garden. There was a bower at
the farther end, all honeysuckles and creeping
plants, and somehow they unconsciously wandered
in its direction and sat down on a bench
within.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 327px;">
<img src="images/illus-261.jpg" width="327" height="500" alt="&quot;Mr. Tupman, We Are Observed!&quot;Page 240" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Mr. Tupman, We Are Observed!&quot;</span><div class='pageref'><a href="#Page_240">Page 240</a></div>
</div>
<p>"Miss Wardle," said Mr. Tupman, "you are an
angel." Miss Rachel blushed very becomingly.
Much more conversation of this nature followed
until finally Mr. Tupman proceeded to do what his
enthusiastic emotions prompted and what were,
(for all we know, for we are but little acquainted
with such matters) what people in such circumstances
always do. She started, and he, throwing
his arms around her neck imprinted upon her lips
numerous kisses, which, after a proper show of
struggling and resistance, she received so passively
that there is no telling how many more Mr. Tupman
might have bestowed if the lady had not
given a very unaffected start and exclaimed:
"Mr. Tupman, we are observed! We are discovered!"</p>

<p>Mr. Tupman looked around. There was the
fat boy perfectly motionless, with his large, circular
eyes staring into the arbor, but without the
slightest expression on his face. Mr. Tupman
gazed at the fat boy and the fat boy stared at him,
but the longer Mr. Tupman observed the utter
vacancy of the fat boy's face, the more convinced
he became that he either did not know or did not
understand anything that had been happening.
Under this impression he said with great fierceness:
"What do you want here?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Supper is ready, sir," was the prompt
reply.</p>

<p>"Have you just come here?" inquired Mr. Tupman,
with a piercing look.</p>

<p>"Just," replied the fat boy. Mr. Tupman
looked at him very hard again but there was not
a wink of his eye or a movement in his face. Mr.
Tupman took the arm of the spinster aunt and
walked toward the house. The fat boy followed
behind.</p>

<p>"He knows nothing of what has happened,"
he whispered.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the spinster aunt. There was
a sound behind them as of an imperfectly suppressed
chuckle. Mr. Tupman turned sharply
around.</p>

<p>No, it could not have been the fat boy. There
was not a gleam of mirth or anything but feeding
in his whole visage. "He must have been fast
asleep," whispered Mr. Tupman.</p>

<p>"I have not the least doubt of it," replied Miss
Rachel, and they both laughed heartily. Mr.
Tupman was wrong. The fat boy for once had
not been fast asleep. He was awake, wide awake
to everything that had happened.</p>

<p>The day following, Joe saw his mistress, Mr.
Wardle's aged mother, sitting in the arbor. Without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
saying a word he walked up to her, stood perfectly
still and said nothing.</p>

<p>The old lady was easily frightened; most old
ladies are, and her first impression was that Joe
was about to do her some bodily harm with a view
of stealing what money she might have with her.
She therefore watched his motions, or rather lack
of motions, with feelings of intense terror, which
were in no degree lessened by his finally coming
close to her and shouting in her ear, for she was
very deaf, "Missus!"</p>

<p>"Well, Joe," said the trembling old lady, "I
am sure I have been a good mistress to you."
He nodded. "You have always been treated very
kindly?" He nodded. "You have never had
too much to do?" He nodded. "You have
always had enough to eat?" This last was an
appeal to the fat boy's most sensitive feelings.
He seemed touched as he replied, "I know I has."</p>

<p>"Then what do you want to do now?"</p>

<p>"I wants to make yo' flesh creep," replied the
boy. This sounded like a very blood-thirsty
method of showing one's gratitude and so the old
lady was as much frightened as before. "What
do you think I saw in this very arbor last night?"
inquired the boy.</p>

<p>"Mercies, what?" screamed the old lady,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
alarmed at the mysterious manner of the corpulent
youth.</p>

<p>"A strange gentleman as had his arm around
her, a kissin' and huggin'."</p>

<p>"Who, Joe, who? None of the servants, I
hope?"</p>

<p>"Worser than that," roared the fat boy in the
old lady's ear.</p>

<p>"None of my granddaughters."</p>

<p>"Worser than that," said Joe.</p>

<p>"Worse than that?" said the old lady, who had
thought this the extreme limit. "Who was it,
Joe? I insist upon knowing!"</p>

<p>The fat boy looked cautiously about and having
finished his survey shouted in the old lady's ear,
"Miss Rachel!"</p>

<p>"What?" said the old lady in a shrill tone,
"speak louder!"</p>

<p>"Miss Rachel," roared the fat boy.</p>

<p>"My daughter?" The succession of nods which
the fat boy gave by way of assent could not be
doubted. "And she allowed him?" exclaimed the
old lady. A grin stole over the fat boy's features
as he said, "I see her a kissin' of him agin!" Joe's
voice of necessity had been so loud that another
party in the garden could not help hearing the
entire conversation. If they could have seen the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
expression of the old lady's face at this time it is
probable that a sudden burst of laughter would
have betrayed them. Fragments of angry sentences
drifted to them through the leaves, such as
"Without my permission!" "At her time of life!"
"Might have waited until I was dead," etc. Then
they heard the heels of the fat boy's foot crunching
the gravel as he retired and left the old lady alone.</p>

<p>Mr. Tupman would probably have found himself
in considerable trouble if one of his friends,
who had overheard the conversation had not told
Mrs. Wardle that perhaps Joe had dreamed the
entire incident, which did not seem altogether
improbable. She watched Mr. Tupman at supper
that evening, but this gentleman, having been
warned, paid no attention whatever to Miss Rachel,
and the old lady was finally persuaded that it was
all a mistake.</p>

<p>Finally the visit of Mr. Pickwick and his friends
came to an end, and it was several months before
they again partook of Mr. Wardle's hospitality.
The Pickwickians had arrived at the Inn near Mr.
Wardle's place for dinner before completing the
rest of their journey to Dingley Dell. Mr. Pickwick
had brought with him several barrels of
oysters and some special wine as a gift to his host,
and he stood examining his packages to see that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
they had all arrived when he felt himself gently
pulled by the skirts of his coat. Looking around
he discovered that the individual who used this
means of drawing his attention was no other
than Mr. Wardle's favorite page, the fat
boy.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the fat boy, and as he said it he
glanced from the wine to the oysters and chuckled
joyously. He was fatter than ever.</p>

<p>"Well, you look rosy enough my young friend,"
said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>"I have been sitting in front of the fire," replied
the fat boy, who had indeed heated himself to the
color of a new chimney pot in the course of an
hour's nap. "Master sent me over with the cart
to carry your luggage over to the house." Mr.
Pickwick called his man, Sam Weller, to him and
said, "Help Mr. Wardle's servant to put the packages
into the cart and then ride on with him. We
prefer to walk." Having given this direction Mr.
Pickwick and his three friends walked briskly
away, leaving Mr. Weller and the fat boy face to
face for the first time. Sam looked at the fat boy
with great astonishment but without saying a
word, and began to put the things rapidly upon the
cart while Joe stood calmly by and seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
think it a very interesting sort of thing to see Mr.
Weller working by himself.</p>

<p>"There," said Sam, "everything packed at last.
There they are."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the fat boy in a very satisfied tone,
"there they are."</p>

<p>"Well, young twenty stone," said Sam. "You're
a nice specimen, you are."</p>

<p>"Thankee," said the fat boy.</p>

<p>"You ain't got nothing on your mind as makes
you fret yourself, have you?" inquired Sam.</p>

<p>"Not as I knows of," replied the boy.</p>

<p>"I should rather have thought, to look at you,
that you was a laborin' under a disappointed love
affair with some young woman," said Sam.
"Vell, young boa-constrictor," said Sam, "I'm
glad to hear it. Do you ever drink anythin'?"</p>

<p>"I likes eatin' better," replied the boy.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Sam. "I should ha' 'sposed that,
but I 'spose you were never cold with all them
elastic fixtures?"</p>

<p>"Was sometimes," replied the boy, "and I
likes a drop of something that's good."</p>

<p>"Ah! you do, do you," said Sam, "come this
way." Then after a short interruption they got
into the cart.</p>

<p>"You can drive, can you?" said the fat boy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should rather think so," replied Sam.</p>

<p>"Well then," said the fat boy, putting the reins
in his hands and pointing up a lane, "it's as
straight as you can drive. You can't miss it."
With these words the fat boy laid himself affectionately
down by the side of the provisions and
placing an oyster barrel under his head for a
pillow, fell asleep instantly.</p>

<p>"Vell," said Sam, "of all the boys ever I set
my eyes on&mdash;wake up young dropsy." But as
young dropsy could not be awakened, Sam Weller
set himself down in front of the cart, started the
old horse with a jerk of the rein, and jogged
steadily on toward Manor Farm.</p>

<h3>A BRAVE AND HONEST BOY, OLIVER TWIST.</h3>


<div class='cap'>LITTLE Oliver Twist was an orphan. He
never saw his mother or his father. He
was born at the workhouse, the home for
paupers, where his poor heart-broken mother had
been taken just a short time before baby Oliver
came; and, the very night he was born, she was so
sick and weak she said: "Let me see my child and
then I will die." The old nurse said: "Nonsense,
my dear, you must not think of dying, you have
something now to live for." The good kind doctor
said she must be very brave and she might get well.
They brought her little baby boy to her, and she
hugged him in her weak arms and she kissed him on
the brow many times and cuddled him up as close
as her feeble arms could hold him; and then she
looked at him long and steadily, and a sweet
smile came over her face and a bright light came
into her eyes, and before the smile could pass
from her lips she died.</div>

<p>The old nurse wept as she took the little baby
from its dead mother's arms; and the good doctor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
had to wipe the tears from his eyes, it was so
very, very sad.</p>

<p>After wrapping the baby in a blanket and laying
him in a warm place, the old nurse straightened
out the limbs of the young mother and folded her
hands on her breast; and, spreading a white
sheet over her still form, she called the doctor
to look at her&mdash;for the nurse and the doctor were
all who were there. The same sweet smile was
on her face, and the doctor said as he looked upon
her: "Poor, poor girl, she is so beautiful and so
young! What strange fate has brought her to
this poor place? Nurse, take good care of the
baby, for his mother must have been, at one time,
a kind and gentle woman."</p>

<p>The next day they took the unknown woman
out to the potter's field and buried her; and, for
nine months, the old nurse at the workhouse
took care of the baby; though, it is sad to say,
this old woman, kind-hearted though she was,
was at the same time so fond of gin that she
often took the money, which ought to have
bought milk for the baby, to buy drink for
herself.</p>

<p>Nobody knew what the young mother's name
was, and so this baby had no name, until, at last,
Mr. Bumble, who was one of the parish officers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
who looked after the paupers, came and named
him <i>Oliver Twist</i>.</p>

<p>When little Oliver was nine months old they
took him away from the workhouse and carried
him to the "Poor Farm," where there were
twenty-five or thirty other poor children who had
no parents. A woman by the name of Mrs.
Mann had charge of this cottage. The parish
gave her an allowance of enough money to keep
the children in plenty of food and clothing; but
she starved the little ones to keep the money
for herself, so that many of them died and others
came to take their places. But young Oliver
was a tough little fellow, and, while he looked very
pale and thin, he was, otherwise, healthy and
hung on to his life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mann was also very cruel to the children.
She would scold and beat them and shut them up
in the cellar and treat them meanly in many ways
when no visitors were there. But, when any of
the men who had control or visitors came around,
she would smile and call the children "dear," and
all sorts of pet names. She told them if any of
them should tell on her she would beat them; and,
furthermore, that they should tell visitors that
she was very kind and good to them and that they
loved her very much.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bumble was a very mean man, too, as we
shall see. They called him the <i>Beadle</i>, which
means he was a sort of sheriff or policeman; and
he was supposed to look after the people at the
workhouse and at the poor farm and to wait on
the directors who had charge of these places.
He had the right to punish the boys if they did
not mind, and they were all afraid of him.</p>

<p>Oliver remained at the cottage on the poor
farm until he was nine years old, though he was
a pale little fellow and did not look to be over
seven.</p>

<p>On the morning of his birthday, Mrs. Mann had
given Oliver and two other boys a bad whipping
and put them down in a dark coal-cellar. Presently
she saw Mr. Bumble coming and she told
her servant to take the boys out and wash them
quick, for she did not let Mr. Bumble know she
ever punished them, and was fearful he might hear
them crying in the dark, damp place. Mrs.
Mann talked very nicely to Mr. Bumble and made
him a "toddy" (a glass of strong liquor) and kept
him busy with her flattering and kindness until
she knew the boys were washed.</p>

<p>Mr. Bumble told her Oliver Twist was nine
years old that day, and the Board (which meant
the men in charge) had decided they must take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
him away from the farm and carry him back to the
workhouse. Mrs. Mann pretended to be very
sorry, and she went out and brought Oliver in,
telling him on the way that he must appear very
sorry to leave her, otherwise she would beat him.
So when Oliver was asked if he wanted to go, he
said he was sorry to leave there. This was not a
falsehood, for, miserable as the place was, he
dearly loved his little companions. They were
all the people he knew; and he did feel sad, and
really wept with sorrow as he told them good-by
and was led by Mr. Bumble back to the workhouse,
where he was born and where his mother
died nine years ago that very day.</p>

<p>When he got back there he found the old nurse
who remembered his mother, and she told him
she was a beautiful sweet woman and how she had
kissed him and held him in her arms when she
died. Night after night little Oliver dreamed
about his beautiful mother, and she seemed
sometimes to stand by his bed and to look down
upon him with the same beautiful eyes and the
same sweet smile of which the nurse told him.
Every time he had the chance he asked questions
about her, but the nurse could not tell him anything
more. She did not even know her name.</p>

<p>Oliver had been at the workhouse only a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
short time when Mr. Bumble came in and told
him he must appear before the Board at once.
Now Oliver was puzzled at this. He thought
a board was a piece of flat wood, and he could not
imagine why he was to appear before that. But
he was too much afraid of Mr. Bumble to ask any
questions. This gentleman had treated him
roughly in bringing him to the workhouse; and,
now, when he looked a little puzzled&mdash;for his
expressive face always told what was in his
honest little heart&mdash;Mr. Bumble gave him a
sharp crack on the head with his cane and another
rap over the back and told him to wake up and
not look so sleepy, and to mind to be polite when
he went before the Board. Oliver could not help
tears coming into his eyes as he was pushed along,
and Mr. Bumble gave him another sharp rap,
telling him to hush, and ushered him into a room
where several stern-looking gentlemen sat at a
long table. One of them, in a white waistcoat,
was particularly hard-looking. "Bow to the
Board," said Mr. Bumble to Oliver. Oliver
looked about for a board, and, seeing none, he
bowed to the table, because it looked more like
a board than anything else. The men laughed,
and the man in the white waistcoat said: "The
boy is a fool. I thought he was." After other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
ugly remarks, they told Oliver he was an orphan
and they had supported him all his life. He ought
to be very thankful. (And he was, when he remembered
how many had been starved to death.)
"Now," they said, "you are nine years old, and
we must put you out to learn a trade." They
told him he should begin the next morning at six
o'clock to pick oakum, and work at that until
they could get him a place.</p>

<p>Oliver was faithful at his work, in which several
other boys assisted, but oh! so hungry they
got, for they were given but one little bowl of
gruel at a meal&mdash;hardly enough for a kitten. So
one day the boys said they must ask for more;
and they "drew straws" to see who should venture
to do so. It fell to Oliver's lot to do it, and the
next meal, when they had emptied their bowls,
Oliver walked up to the man who helped them and
said very politely, "Please, sir, may I not have
some more? I am very hungry." This made
the man so angry that he hit Oliver over the head
with his ladle and called for Mr. Bumble. He
came, and when told that Oliver had "asked for
more," he grabbed him by the collar and took
him before the Board and made the complaint
that he had been very naughty and rebellious,
telling the circumstance in an unfair and untruthful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
way. The Board was angry at Oliver, and the
man in the white waistcoat told them again as
he had said before. "This boy will be hung sometime.
We must get rid of him at once." So
they offered five pounds, or twenty-five dollars
to anyone who would take him.</p>

<p>The first man who came was a very mean chimney-sweeper,
who had almost killed other boys with
his vile treatment. The Board agreed to let him
have Oliver; but, when they took him before the
magistrates, Oliver fell on his knees and begged
them not to let that man have him, and they
would not. So Oliver was taken back to the workhouse.</p>

<p>The next man who came was Mr. Sowerberry,
an undertaker. He was a very good man, and
the magistrates let him take Oliver along. But he
had a very cross, stingy wife, and a mean servant-girl
by the name of Charlotte, and a big overbearing
boy by the name of Noah Claypole, whom he had
taken to raise. Oliver thought he would like Mr.
Sowerberry well enough, but his heart fell when
"the Mrs." met him and called him "boy" and a
"measly-looking little pauper," and gave him for
supper the scraps she had put for the dog. But
this was so much better than he got at the workhouse,
he would not complain about the food;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and he hoped, by faithful work, to win kind treatment.</p>

<p>They made him sleep by himself in the shop
among the coffins, and he was very much frightened;
but he would rather sleep there than with
the terrible boy, Noah. The first night he
dreamed of his beautiful mother, and thought
again he could see her sitting among those black,
fearful coffins, with the same sweet smile upon
her face. He was awakened the next morning
by Noah, who told him he had to obey him, and
he'd better lookout or he'd wear the life out of
him. Noah kicked and cuffed Oliver several
times, but the poor boy was too much used to that
to resent it, and determined to do his work well.</p>

<p>Mr. Sowerberry found Oliver so good, sensible,
and polite that he made him his assistant and took
him to all the funerals, and occasionally gave him
a penny. Oliver went into fine houses and saw
people and sights he had never dreamed of before.
Mr. Sowerberry had told him he might some day
be an undertaker himself; and Oliver worked hard
to please his master, though Noah and Mrs.
Sowerberry and Charlotte grew more unkind to
him all the time, because "he was put forward,"
they said, "and Noah was kept back." This, of
course, made Noah meaner than ever to Oliver&mdash;determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
to endure it all rather than complain,
and try to win them over after while by being
kind. He could have borne any insult to himself,
but Noah tried the little fellow too far when he
attacked the name of Oliver's mother, and it
brought serious trouble, as we shall see.</p>

<p>One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into
the kitchen at the usual dinner-hour, when,
Charlotte being called out of the way, there came
a few minutes of time, which Noah Claypole, being
hungry and vicious, considered he could not
possibly devote to a worthier purpose than
aggravating and tantalizing young Oliver
Twist.</p>

<p>Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah
put his feet on the tablecloth; and pulled Oliver's
hair; and twitched his ears; and expressed his
opinion that he was a "sneak;" and furthermore
announced his intention of coming to see him
hanged, whenever that desirable event should
take place; and entered upon various other topics
of petty annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned
charity-boy as he was. But, none
of these taunts producing the desired effect of
making Oliver cry, Noah began to talk about his
mother.</p>

<p>"Work'us," said Noah, "how's your mother?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Noah had given Oliver this name because he had
come from the workhouse.</p>

<p>"She's dead," replied Oliver; "don't you say
anything about her to me!"</p>

<p>Oliver's color rose as he said this; he breathed
quickly; and there was a curious working of the
mouth and nostrils, which Noah thought must
be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of
crying. Under this impression he returned to
the charge.</p>

<p>"What did she die of, Work'us?" said Noah.</p>

<p>"Of a broken-heart, some of our old nurses told
me," replied Oliver: more as if he were talking to
himself than answering Noah. "I think I know
what it must be to die of that!"</p>

<p>"Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work'us,"
said Noah, as a tear rolled down Oliver's check.
"What's set you a sniveling now?"</p>

<p>"Not <i>you</i>," replied Oliver, hastily brushing the
tear away. "Don't think it."</p>

<p>"Oh, not me, eh?" sneered Noah.</p>

<p>"No, not you," replied Oliver, sharply.</p>

<p>"There, that's enough. Don't say anything
more to me about her; you'd better not!"</p>

<p>"Better not!" exclaimed Noah. "Well! Better
not! Work'us, don't be impudent. <i>Your</i> mother,
too! She was a nice 'un, she was. Oh, Lor'!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
And here Noah nodded his head expressively and
curled his small red nose.</p>

<p>"Yer know, Work'us," continued Noah, emboldened
by Oliver's silence, and speaking in a
jeering tone of affected pity. "Yer know, Work'us,
it can't be helped now; and of course yer
couldn't help it then. But yer must know,
Work'us, yer mother was a regular-down bad
'un."</p>

<p>"What did you say?" inquired Oliver, looking
up very quickly.</p>

<p>"A regular right-down bad'un, Work'us," replied
Noah, coolly. "And it's a great deal better,
Work'us, that she died when she did, or else she'd
have been hard laboring in the jail, or sent out of
the country, or hung; which is more likely than
either, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Crimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew
the chair and table; seized Noah by the
throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till
his teeth chattered in his head; and, collecting his
whole force into one heavy blow, felled him to the
ground.</p>

<p>A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet,
mild, dejected creature that harsh treatment had
made him. But his spirit was roused at last;
the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
blood on fire. His breast heaved; his form was
erect; his eye bright and vivid; his whole person
changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly
tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet;
and defied him with an energy he had never known
before.</p>

<p>"He'll murder me!" blubbered Noah. "Charlotte!
missis! Here's the new boy a-murdering
of me! Help! help! Oliver's gone mad! Char&mdash;lotte!"</p>

<p>Noah's shouts were responded to by a loud
scream from Charlotte and a louder from Mrs.
Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the
kitchen by a side-door, while the latter paused on
the staircase till she was quite certain that it was
safe to come farther down.</p>

<p>"Oh, you little wretch!" screamed Charlotte,
seizing Oliver with her utmost force, which was
about equal to that of a moderately strong man
in particularly good training. "Oh, you little
un-grate-ful, mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!" And
between every syllable Charlotte gave Oliver a
blow with all her might.</p>

<p>Charlotte's fist was by no means a light one;
and Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into the kitchen and
assisted to hold him with one hand, while she
scratched his face with the other. In this favorable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
position of affairs, Noah rose from the ground
and pommeled him behind.</p>

<p>When they were all wearied out, and could tear
and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver, struggling
and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the
dust-cellar, and there locked him up. This being
done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a chair and burst
into tears.</p>

<p>"Oh! Charlotte," said Mrs. Sowerberry. "Oh!
Charlotte, what a mercy we have not all been
murdered in our beds!"</p>

<p>"Ah! mercy indeed, ma'am," was the reply.
"I only hope this'll teach master not to have any
more of these dreadful creatures, that are born
to be murderers and robbers from their very
cradle. Poor Noah! he was all but killed, ma'am,
when I come in."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" said Mrs. Sowerberry, looking
piteously on the charity-boy.</p>

<p>"What's to be done!" exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.
"Your master's not at home; there's not
a man in the house, and he'll kick that door down
in ten minutes." Oliver's vigorous plunges
against the door did seem as if he would break it.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear! I don't know, ma'am," said
Charlotte, "unless we send for the police officers."</p>

<p>"Or the millingtary," suggested Noah.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no," said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking
herself of Oliver's old friend. "Run to Mr.
Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly,
and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap!
Make haste!"</p>

<p>Noah set off with all his might, and paused
not once for breath until he reached the workhouse
gate.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with the boy!" said
the people as Noah rushed up.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bumble! Mr. Bumble!" cried Noah,
with well-pretended alarm. "Oh, Mr. Bumble,
sir! Oliver, sir&mdash;Oliver has&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? What?" interposed Mr. Bumble, with
a gleam of pleasure in his steel-like eyes. "Not
run away; he hasn't run away, has he, Noah?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, no! Not run away, sir, but he's
turned wicious," replied Noah. "He tried to
murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder
Charlotte; and then missis. Oh! what dreadful
pain it is! Such agony, please, sir!" And here
Noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive
variety of eel-like positions, by which the
gentleman's notice was very soon attracted;
for he had not walked three paces, when he turned
angrily round and inquired what that young cur
was howling for.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a poor boy from the free-school, sir,"
replied Mr. Bumble, "who has been nearly murdered&mdash;all
but murdered, sir&mdash;by young Twist."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed the gentleman in the
white waistcoat, stopping short. "I knew it!
I felt from the very first that that terrible young
savage would come to be hung!"</p>

<p>"He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the
female servant," said Mr. Bumble, with a face of
ashy paleness.</p>

<p>"And his missis," interposed Noah.</p>

<p>"And his master, too. I think you said, Noah?"
added Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p>"No! he's out, or he would have murdered
him," replied Noah. "He said he wanted
to."</p>

<p>"Ah! Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?"
inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. And please, sir," replied Noah,
"missis wants to know whether Mr. Bumble can
spare time to step up there, directly, and flog
him&mdash;'cause master's out."</p>

<p>"Certainly, my boy; certainly," said the gentleman
in the white waistcoat, smiling benignly and
patting Noah's head, which was about three inches
higher than his own. "You're a good boy&mdash;a
very good boy. Here's a penny for you. Bumble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
just step up to Sowerberry's with your cane,
and see what's to be done. Don't spare him,
Bumble."</p>

<p>"No, I will not, sir," replied the beadle as he
hurried away.</p>

<p>Meantime, Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished
vigor, at the cellar-door. The accounts
of his ferocity, as related by Mrs. Sowerberry
and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature
that Mr. Bumble judged it prudent to parley
before opening the door. With this view he gave
a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and
then, putting his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a
deep and impressive tone:</p>

<p>"Oliver!"</p>

<p>"Come, you let me out!" replied Oliver, from
the inside.</p>

<p>"Do you know this here voice, Oliver?" said
Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Oliver.</p>

<p>"Ain't you afraid of it, sir? Ain't you a-trembling
while I speak, sir?" said Mr. Bumble.</p>

<p>"No!" replied Oliver, boldly.</p>

<p>An answer so different from the one he had
expected to hear, and was in the habit of receiving,
staggered Mr. Bumble not a little.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
said Mrs. Sowerberry. "No boy in half his senses
could venture to speak so to you."</p>

<p>"It's not madness, ma'am," replied Mr. Bumble,
after a few moments of deep meditation.
"It's meat."</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.</p>

<p>"Meat, ma'am, meat," replied Bumble, with
stern emphasis. "You've overfed him, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry,
piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling;
"this comes of being liberal!"</p>

<p>The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver had
consisted in a bestowal upon him of all the dirty
odds and ends which nobody else would eat.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought
her eyes down to earth again; "the only thing
that can be done now, that I know of, is to leave
him in the cellar for a day or so, till he's a little
starved down; and then to take him out, and
keep him on gruel all through his apprenticeship.
He comes of a bad family. Excitable natures,
Mrs. Sowerberry! Both the nurse and doctor
said that that mother of his made her way
here, against difficulties and pain that would have
killed any well-disposed woman, weeks before."</p>

<p>At this point of Mr. Bumble's discourse, Oliver,
just hearing enough to know that some new allusion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
was being made to his mother, recommenced
kicking, with a violence that rendered every
other sound inaudible. Sowerberry returned at
this moment. Oliver's offense having been explained
to him, with such exaggerations as the
ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire,
he unlocked the cellar-door in a twinkling, and
dragged his rebellious apprentice out by the collar.</p>

<p>Oliver's clothes had been torn in the beating
he had received; his face was bruised and scratched;
and his hair scattered over his forehead.
The angry flush had not disappeared, however;
and when he was pulled out of his prison, he
scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite undismayed.</p>

<p>"Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain't you?"
said Sowerberry, giving Oliver a shake and a box
on the ear.</p>

<p>"He called my mother names," replied Oliver.</p>

<p>"Well, and what if he did, you little ungrateful
wretch?" said Mrs. Sowerberry. "She deserved
what he said, and worse."</p>

<p>"She didn't," said Oliver.</p>

<p>"She did," said Mrs. Sowerberry.</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" said Oliver.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
else to do; so he at once gave Oliver a drubbing,
which satisfied even Mrs. Sowerberry herself.
For the rest of the day he was shut up in the backs
kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of
bread; and, at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after
making various remarks outside the door, by no
means kind to the memory of his mother, looked
into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings
of Noah and Charlotte, ordered him up-stairs to
his dismal bed.</p>

<p>It was not until he was left alone in the silence
and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker
that Oliver gave way to the feelings which
the day's treatment may be supposed likely to
have awakened in a mere child. He had listened
to their taunts with a look of contempt; he had
borne the lash without a cry; for he felt that
pride swelling in his heart which would have kept
down a shriek to the last, though they had
roasted him alive. But now, when there was
none to see or hear him, he fell upon his knees on
the floor; and, hiding his face in his hands, wept
bitter tears and prayed in his bleeding heart that
God would help him to get away from these cruel
people. There, upon his knees, Oliver determined
to run away, and, rising, tied up a few clothes in a
handkerchief and went to bed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>With the first ray of light that struggled through
the crevices in the shutters, Oliver arose and
unbarred the door. One timid look around&mdash;one
moment's pause of hesitation&mdash;he had closed
it behind him, and was in the open street.</p>

<p>He looked to the right and to the left, uncertain
which way to fly. He remembered to have seen
the wagons, as they went out, toiling up the hill.
He took the same route; and arriving at a foot-path
across the fields, which he knew, after some
distance, led out again into the road, struck into it,
and walked quickly on.</p>

<p>Along this same foot-path, Oliver well remembered
he had trotted beside Mr. Bumble when he
first carried him to the workhouse from the farm.
His heart beat quickly when he bethought himself
of this, and he half resolved to turn back.
He had come a long way though, and should lose
a great deal of time by doing so. Besides, it was
so early that there was very little fear of his being
seen; so he walked on.</p>

<p>He reached the house. There was no appearance
of the people inside stirring at that early
hour. Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden.
A child was weeding one of the little beds;
as he stopped, he raised his pale face and disclosed
the features of one of his former companions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Oliver felt glad to see him before he went;
for, though younger than himself, he had been his
little friend and playmate. They had been
beaten, and starved, and shut up together many
and many a time.</p>

<p>"Hush, Dick!" said Oliver, as the boy ran to the
gate, and thrust his thin arm between the rails to
greet him. "Is anyone up?"</p>

<p>"Nobody but me," replied the child.</p>

<p>"You mustn't say you saw me, Dick," said
Oliver. "I am running away. They beat and
ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune
some long way off. I don't know where.
How pale you are!"</p>

<p>"I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,"
replied the child, with a faint smile. "I am very
glad to see you, dear; but don't stop, don't
stop!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I will to say good-by to you,"
replied Oliver. "I shall see you again, Dick. I
know I shall. You will be well and happy!"</p>

<p>"I hope so," replied the child. "After I am
dead, but not before. I know the doctor must be
right, Oliver, because I dream so much of
heaven and angels, and kind faces that I never see
when I am awake. Kiss me," said the child,
climbing up the low gate, and flinging his little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
arms around Oliver's neck: "Good-by, dear!
God bless you!"</p>

<p>The blessing was from a young child's lips, but
it was the first that Oliver had ever heard invoked
upon his head; and through the struggles and
sufferings, and troubles and changes of his after-life,
he never once forgot it.</p>

<p>Oliver soon got into the high-road. It was
eight o'clock now. Though he was nearly five
miles away from the town, he ran, and hid
behind the hedges, by turns, till noon, fearing
that he might be pursued and overtaken.
Then he sat down to rest by the side of the mile-stone.</p>

<p>The stone by which he was seated had a sign
on it which said that it was just seventy miles
from that spot to London. The name awakened
a new train of ideas in the boy's mind, London!&mdash;that
great large place!&mdash;nobody&mdash;not even Mr.
Bumble&mdash;could ever find him there! He had
often heard the old men in the workhouse, too, say
that no lad of spirit need want in London; and
that there were ways of living in that vast city
which those who had been bred in the country
parts had no idea of. It was the very place for
a homeless boy, who must die in the streets unless
some-one helped him. As these things passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet and
again walked forward.</p>

<p>He had made the distance between himself and
London less by full four miles more, before he
thought how much he must undergo ere he could
hope to reach the place toward which he was going.
As this consideration forced itself upon him,
he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon
his means of getting there. He had a crust of
bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings in
his bundle. He had a penny too&mdash;a gift of
Sowerberry's after some funeral in which he had
acquitted himself more than ordinarily well&mdash;in his
pocket. "A clean shirt," thought Oliver, "is a very
comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned
stockings; and so is a penny; but they are small
helps to a sixty-five miles' walk in winter-time."</p>

<p>Thus day after day the weary but plucky little
boy walked on, and early on the seventh morning
after he had left his native place, Oliver limped
slowly into the little town of Barnet, and sat down
on a doorstep to rest. Some few stopped to gaze
at Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to
stare at him as they hurried by; but none helped
him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he
came there. He had no heart to beg. And there
he sat for some time when he was roused by observing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
that a boy was watching him most earnestly
from the opposite side of the way. He took little
heed of this at first; but the boy remained in the
same attitude so long that Oliver raised his head
and returned his steady look. Upon this, the boy
crossed over, and, walking close up to Oliver, said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, my covey! What's the row?"</p>

<p>The boy who had spoken to the young wayfarer
was about his own age: but one of the
queerest-looking boys that Oliver had ever seen.
He was a snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced
boy enough; and as dirty a youth as one
would wish to see; but he had about him all the
airs and manners of a man. He was short for his
age; with rather bow-legs, and little, sharp, ugly
eyes. His hat was stuck on the top of his head
so lightly that it threatened to fall off every
moment. He wore a man's coat, which reached
nearly to his heels.</p>

<p>"Hullo, my covey! What's the row?" said the
stranger.</p>

<p>"I am very hungry and tired," replied Oliver:
the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke. "I
have walked a long way. I have been walking
these seven days."</p>

<p>"Walking for sivin days!" said the young gentleman.
"Oh, I see. Beak's order, eh? But," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
added, noticing Oliver's look of surprise, "I suppose
you don't know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on."</p>

<p>Oliver mildly replied that he had always heard
a bird's mouth described by the word beak.</p>

<p>"My eyes, how green!" exclaimed the young
gentleman. "Why, a beak's a madgst'rate; and
when you walk by a beak's order, it's not straight
forerd.</p>

<p>"But come," said the young gentleman; "you
want grub, and you shall have it. Up with you
on your pins. There! Now then!"</p>

<p>Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman
took him to a near by grocery store, where he
bought a supply of ready-dressed ham and a half-quartern
loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, "a
fourpenny bran!" Taking the bread under his
arm, the young gentleman turned into a small
public-house, and led the way to a tap-room in the
rear of the premises. Here a pot of beer was
brought in by direction of the mysterious youth;
and Oliver, falling to at his new friend's bidding,
made a long and hearty meal, during which the
strange boy eyed him from time to time with great
attention.</p>

<p>"Going to London?" said the strange boy, when
Oliver had at length concluded.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Got any lodgings?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Money?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The strange boy whistled, and put his arms into
his pockets as far as the big coat-sleeves would let
them go.</p>

<p>"Do you live in London?" inquired Oliver.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, when I'm at home," replied the boy.
"I suppose you want some place to sleep in to-night,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"I do, indeed," answered Oliver. "I have not
slept under a roof since I left the country."</p>

<p>"Don't fret your eyelids on that score," said the
young gentleman. "I've got to be in London
to-night; and I know a 'spectable old genelman
as lives there, wot'll give you lodgings for nothink,
and never ask for the change&mdash;that is, if any
genelman he knows interduces you. And don't
he know me? Oh, no! not in the least! By no
means. Certainly not!" which was his queer way
of saying he and the old gentleman were good
friends.</p>

<p>This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting
to be resisted, especially as it was immediately
followed up by the assurance that the old gentleman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
referred to would doubtless provide Oliver
with a comfortable place, without loss of time.
This led to a more friendly and free talk, from
which Oliver learned that his friend's name was
Jack Dawkins&mdash;among his intimate friends better
known as the "Artful Dodger"&mdash;and that he was a
peculiar pet of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.</p>

<p>As John Dawkins objected to their entering
London before nightfall, it was nearly eleven
o'clock when they reached the small city street,
along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace,
directing Oliver to follow close at his heels.</p>

<p>Although Oliver had enough to occupy his
attention in keeping sight of his leader, he could
not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either
side of the way as he passed along. A dirtier or
more wretched place he had never seen.</p>

<p>Oliver was just considering whether he hadn't
better run away, when they reached the bottom of
the hill. His conductor, catching him by the
arm, pushed open the door of a house, and, drawing
him into the passage, closed it behind them.</p>

<p>"Now, then!" cried a voice from below, in reply
to a whistle from the Dodger.</p>

<p>"Plummy and slam!" was the reply.</p>

<p>This seemed to be some watchword or signal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
that all was right; for the light of a feeble candle
gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage,
and a man's face peeped out from where a
balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been
broken away.</p>

<p>"There's two <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'on'">of</ins>  you," said the man, thrusting
the candle farther out, and shading his eyes with
his hand. "Who's the t'other one?"</p>

<p>"A new pal," replied Jack Dawkins, pulling
Oliver forward.</p>

<p>"Where did he come from?"</p>

<p>"Greenland. Is Fagin up-stairs?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he's a sortin' the wipes. Up with you!"
The candle was drawn back, and the face disappeared.</p>

<p>Oliver, groping his way with one hand, and
having the other firmly grasped by his companion,
ascended with much difficulty the dark and
broken stairs; which his conductor mounted with
an ease and expedition that showed he was well
acquainted with them. He threw open the door
of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him.</p>

<p>The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly
black with age and dirt. There was a deal table
before the fire, upon which were a candle stuck
in a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter-pots,
a loaf and butter, and a plate. Seated round the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
table were four or five boys, none older than the
Dodger, smoking clay pipes and drinking spirits,
with the air of middle-aged men. These all
crowded about their friend as he whispered a few
words to the Jewish proprietor; and then turned
round and grinned at Oliver. So did the Jew
himself, toasting-fork in hand.</p>

<p>"This is him, Fagin," said Jack Dawkins; "my
friend, Oliver Twist."</p>

<p>The Jew grinned, and, making a low bow to
Oliver, took him by the hand, and hoped he should
have the honor of a closer acquaintance. Upon
this, the young gentlemen with the pipes came
round him and shook both his hands very hard.</p>

<p>"We are very glad to see you. Oliver, very,"
said the Jew. "Dodger, take off the sausages, and
draw a tub near the fire for Oliver. Ah! you're
a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh, my
dear! There are a good many of 'em, ain't there?
We've just looked 'em out, ready for the wash:
that's all, Oliver&mdash;that's all. Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>The latter part of this speech was hailed by a
noisy shout from all the pupils of the merry old
gentleman; in the midst of which they went to
supper.</p>

<p>Oliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed
him a glass of hot gin and water, telling him he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
must drink it off directly, because another gentleman
wanted the tumbler. Oliver did as he was
desired. Immediately afterward he felt himself
gently lifted on to one of the sacks; and then he
sunk into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>It was late next morning when Oliver awoke
from a sound, long sleep. There was no other
person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling
some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and
whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round
and round with an iron spoon. He would stop
every now and then to listen when there was the
least noise below; and when he had satisfied himself,
he would go on, whistling and stirring again,
as before.</p>

<p>Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep,
he was not thoroughly awake.</p>

<p>Oliver was precisely in this condition. He saw
the Jew with his half-closed eyes; heard his low
whistling; and recognized the sound of the spoon
grating against the saucepan's sides.</p>

<p>When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the
saucepan to the hob, looked at Oliver, and called
him by his name. He did not answer, and was
to all appearance asleep.</p>

<p>After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew
stepped gently to the door, which he fastened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
He then drew forth, as it seemed to Oliver, from
some trap in the floor, a small box, which he placed
carefully on the table. His eyes glistened as he
raised the lid and looked in. Dragging an old
chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a
magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders
and distorting every feature with a hideous grin.
"Clever dogs! Clever dogs! Stanch to the last!
Never told the old parson where they were.
Never peached upon old Fagin! And why should
they? It wouldn't have loosened the knot, or
kept the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no!
Fine fellows! Fine fellows!"</p>

<p>With these and other muttered remarks of the
like nature, the Jew once more laid the watch in its
place of safety. At least half a dozen more were
severally drawn forth from the same box, and
looked at with equal pleasure; besides rings, bracelets,
and other articles of jewelry, of such magnificent
materials, and costly workmanship, that
Oliver had no idea even of their names.</p>

<p>As the Jew looked up, his bright dark eyes,
which had been staring at the jewelry, fell on
Oliver's face; the boy's eyes were fixed on his
in mute curiosity; and although the recognition
was only for an instant, it was enough to show the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
old man that he had been observed. He closed
the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying
his hand on a bread-knife which was on the table,
started furiously up.</p>

<p>"What's that?" said the Jew. "What do you
watch me for? Why are you awake? What
have you seen? Speak out boy! Quick&mdash;quick!
for your life!"</p>

<p>"I wasn't able to sleep any longer, sir," replied
Oliver, meekly. "I am very sorry if I have disturbed
you, sir."</p>

<p>"You were not awake an hour ago?" said the
Jew, scowling fiercely.</p>

<p>"No! No, indeed!" replied Oliver.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" cried the Jew, with a still
fiercer look than before, and a threatening attitude.</p>

<p>"Upon my word I was not, sir," replied Oliver,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Tush, tush, my dear!" said the Jew, abruptly
resuming his old manner, and playing with the
knife a little, before he laid it down; to make
Oliver think that he had caught it up in mere
sport. "Of course I know that, my dear. I only
tried to frighten you. You're a brave boy. Ha!
ha! you're a brave boy, Oliver!" The Jew
rubbed his hands with a chuckle, but glanced
uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you see any of these pretty things, my
dear?" said the Jew, laying his hand upon it after
a short pause.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Oliver.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Jew, turning rather pale. "They&mdash;they're
mine, Oliver: my little property. All
I have to live upon in my old age. The folks call
me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that's
all."</p>

<p>Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a
decided miser to live in such a dirty place, with so
many watches; but, thinking that perhaps his
fondness for the Dodger and the other boys cost
him a good deal of money, he only looked kindly
at the Jew, and asked if he might get up.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear, certainly," replied the old
gentleman. "There's a pitcher of water in the
corner by the door. Bring it here, and I'll give
you a basin to wash in, my dear."</p>

<p>Oliver got up, walked across the room, and
stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher. When
he turned his head the box was gone.</p>

<p>He had scarcely washed himself, and made
everything tidy by emptying the basin out of the
window, agreeably to the Jew's directions, when
the Dodger returned, accompanied by a very
sprightly young friend, whom Oliver had seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
smoking on the previous night, and who was now
formally introduced to him as Charley Bates.
The four sat down to breakfast on the coffee and
some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had
brought home in the crown of his hat.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver,
and addressing himself to the Dodger, "I hope
you've been at work this morning, my dears?"</p>

<p>"Hard," replied the Dodger.</p>

<p>"As nails," added Charley Bates.</p>

<p>"Good boys, good boys!" said the Jew. "What
have <i>you</i>, Dodger?"</p>

<p>"A couple of pocket-books," replied that young
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Lined?" inquired the Jew, with eagerness.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," replied the Dodger, producing
two pocket-books.</p>

<p>"Not so heavy as they might be," said the Jew,
after looking at the insides carefully; "but very
neat and nicely made. A good workman, ain't he,
Oliver?"</p>

<p>"Very, indeed, sir," said Oliver. At which Mr.
Charles Bates laughed uproariously, very much
to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to
laugh at in anything that had passed.</p>

<p>"And what have you got, my dear?" said Fagin
to Charley Bates.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wipes," replied Master Bates; at the same
time producing four pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Jew, inspecting them closely;
"they're very good ones, very. You haven't
marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks
shall be picked out with a needle, and we'll teach
Oliver how to do it. Shall us, Oliver, eh? Ha!
ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said Oliver.</p>

<p>"You'd like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs
as easy as Charley Bates, wouldn't you,
my dear?" said the Jew.</p>

<p>"Very much, indeed, if you'll teach me, sir,"
replied Oliver.</p>

<p>Master Bates burst into another laugh.</p>

<p>"He is so jolly green!" said Charley when he
recovered, as an apology to the company for his
impolite behavior.</p>

<p>The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed
Oliver's hair over his eyes, and said he'd know
better by-and-by.</p>

<p>When the breakfast was cleared away, the
merry old gentleman and the two boys played at a
very curious and uncommon game, which was
performed in this way: The merry old gentleman,
placing a snuff-box in one pocket of his trousers,
a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck,
and sticking a mock-diamond pin in his shirt,
buttoned his coat tight around him, and putting
his spectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets,
trotted up and down the room with a stick, in
imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen
walk about the streets any hour in the day.</p>

<p>Now during all this time the two boys followed
him closely about, getting out of his sight, so
nimbly, every time he turned round that it was
impossible to follow their motions. At last the
Dodger trod upon his toes or ran upon his boot
accidentally, while Charley Bates stumbled up
against him behind; and in that one moment they
took from him, with the most extraordinary rapidity,
snuff-box, note-case, watch-guard, chain,
shirt-pin, pocket handkerchief, even the spectacle-case.
If the old gentleman felt a hand in any one
of his pockets, he cried out where it was, and then
the game began all over again.</p>

<p>When this game had been played a great many
times, Charley Bates expressed his opinion that
it was time to pad the hoof. This, it occurred to
Oliver, must be French for going out; for, directly
afterward, the Dodger and Charley went away
together, having been kindly furnished by the
amiable old Jew with money to spend.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, my dear," said Fagin. "That's a
pleasant life, isn't it? They have gone out for the
day."</p>

<p>"Have they done work, sir?" inquired Oliver.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Jew; "that is, unless they
should unexpectedly come across any when they
are out; and they won't neglect it, if they do, my
dear, depend upon it. Make 'em your models,
my dear. Make 'em your models," tapping the
fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his words;
"do everything they bid you, and take their
advice in all matters&mdash;especially the Dodger's
my dear. He'll be a great man himself, and will
make you one too, if you take pattern by him.
Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my
dear?" said the Jew, stopping short.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Oliver.</p>

<p>"See if you can take it out, without my feeling
it, as you saw them do when we were at play this
morning."</p>

<p>Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with
one hand, as he had seen the Dodger hold it, and
drew the handkerchief lightly out with the other.</p>

<p>"Is it gone?" cried the Jew.</p>

<p>"Here it is, sir," said Oliver, showing it in his
hand.</p>

<p>"You're a clever boy, my dear," said the playful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head
approvingly. "I never saw a sharper lad. Here's
a shilling for you. If you go on in this way, you'll
be the greatest man of the time. And now come
here, and I'll show you how to take the marks out
of the handkerchief."</p>

<p>Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman's
pocket in play had to do with his chances
of being a great man. But, thinking that the
Jew, being so much older must know best, he
followed him quietly to the table, and was soon
deeply at work in his new study.</p>

<p>For many days Oliver remained in the Jew's
room, picking the marks out of the pocket-handkerchiefs
(of which a great number were brought
home), and sometimes taking part in the game
already described, which the two boys and the
Jew played, regularly, every morning.</p>

<p>At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the
permission to go out with the boys. There had
been no handkerchiefs to work upon for two or
three days, and the dinners had been rather
meager. Perhaps these were reasons for the old
gentleman giving his assent; but, whether they
were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed
him under the joint care of Charley Bates and his
friend, the Dodger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>The three boys started out; the Dodger with his
coat-sleeves tucked up and his hat cocked, as
usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his
hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them,
wondering where they were going, and what they
would teach him to make first.</p>

<p>They were just coming from a narrow court
not far from an open square, which is yet called
"The Green," when the Dodger made a sudden
stop, and, laying his finger on his lip, drew his
companions back again, with the greatest caution.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded Oliver.</p>

<p>"Hush!" replied the Dodger. "Do you see that
old cove at the book-stall?"</p>

<p>"The old gentleman over the way?" said Oliver.
"Yes, I see him."</p>

<p>"He'll do," said the Dodger.</p>

<p>"A prime plant," observed Master Charley
Bates.</p>

<p>Oliver looked from one to the other with the
greatest surprise, but he was not permitted to
make any inquiries; for the two boys walked
stealthily across the road and slunk close behind
the old gentleman. Oliver walked a few paces
after them, and, not knowing whether to advance
or retire, stood looking on in silent amazement.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
personage, with a powdered head and gold
spectacles, as he stood reading a book; and what
was Oliver's horror and alarm as he stood a few
paces off, looking on with his eyelids as wide open
as they would possibly go, to see the Dodger
plunge his hand into the old gentleman's pocket
and draw from thence a handkerchief! To see
him hand the same to Charley Bates; and finally
to behold them both running away round the
corner.</p>

<p>In an instant the whole mystery of the handkerchiefs,
and the watches, and the jewels, and the
Jew, rushed upon the boy's mind. He stood, for
a moment, with the blood so tingling through all
his veins from terror that he felt as if he were in a
burning fire; then, confused and frightened, he
took to his heels, and, not knowing what he did,
made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the
ground.</p>

<p>This was all done in a minute's space. In the
very instant when Oliver began to run, the old
gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and
missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round.
Seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid
pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the
thief; and, shouting "Stop thief!" with all his
might, made off after him, book in hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>But the old gentleman was not the only person
who raised the hue-and-cry. The Dodger and
Master Bates, unwilling to attract public attention
by running down the open street, had merely
retired into the very first doorway round the corner.
They no sooner heard the cry, and saw
Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the
matter stood, they issued forth with great quickness;
and shouting "Stop thief!" too, joined in the
pursuit like good citizens.</p>

<p>Away they ran, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash;
tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down
the passengers as they turn the corners, rousing up
the dogs, and astonishing the fowls; and making
streets, squares, and courts re-echo with the
sound.</p>

<p>At last a burly fellow struck Oliver a terrible
blow and he went down upon the pavement;
and the crowd eagerly gathered round him, each
newcomer jostling and struggling with the others
to catch a glimpse. "Stand aside!" "Give him
a little air!" "Nonsense! he don't deserve it!"
"Where's the gentleman?" "Here he is, coming
down the street." "Make room there for the
gentleman!" "Is this the boy, sir?"</p>

<p>Oliver lay covered with mud and dust, and
bleeding from the mouth, looking wildly round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when
the old gentleman was officiously dragged and
pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the gentleman, "I am afraid it is
the boy."</p>

<p>"Afraid!" murmured the crowd. "That's a
good 'un!"</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" said the gentleman, "he has hurt
himself."</p>

<p>"I did that, sir," said a great lubberly fellow,
stepping forward; "and preciously I cut my
knuckle agin his mouth. I stopped him,
sir."</p>

<p>The fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting
something for his pains; but the old gentleman,
eyeing him with an expression of dislike,
looked anxiously round, as if he contemplated
running away himself; which it is very possible
he might have attempted to do, and thus have
afforded another chase, had not a police officer
(who is generally the last person to arrive in such
cases) at that moment made his way through the
crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar.</p>

<p>"Come, get up," said the man, roughly.</p>

<p>"It wasn't me, indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it
was two other boys," said Oliver, clasping his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
hands passionately and looking round. "They are
here somewhere."</p>

<p>"Oh no, they ain't," said the officer. He meant
this to be ironical, but it was true besides; for the
Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off down the
first convenient court they came to. "Come, get
up!"</p>

<p>"Don't hurt him," said the old gentleman,
compassionately.</p>

<p>"Oh no, I won't hurt him," replied the officer,
tearing his jacket half off his back, in proof thereof.
"Come, I know you; it won't do. Will you stand
upon your legs, you young devil?"</p>

<p>Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to
raise himself on his feet, and was at once lugged
along the streets by the jacket-collar at a rapid
pace. The gentleman walked on with them by the
officer's side.</p>

<p>At last they came to a place called Mutton Hill.
Here he was led beneath a low archway, and up a
dirty court, where they saw a stout man with a
bunch of whiskers on his face and a bunch of keys
in his hand.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" said the man carelessly.</p>

<p>"A young fogle-hunter," replied the officer who
had Oliver in charge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you the party that's been robbed, sir?"
inquired the man with the keys.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," replied the old gentleman; "but
I am not sure that this boy actually took the
handkerchief. I would rather not press the case."</p>

<p>"Must go before the magistrate now, sir," replied
the man. "His worship will be disengaged in half
a minute. Now, young gallows!"</p>

<p>This was an invitation for Oliver to enter
through a door which he unlocked as he spoke,
and which led into a stone cell. Here he was
searched, and, nothing being found upon him,
locked up.</p>

<p>The old gentleman looked almost as unhappy as
Oliver when the key grated in the lock.</p>

<p>At last this gentleman, Mr. Brownlow, was
summoned before the magistrate&mdash;a very mean
man, whose name was Fang. Oliver was brought
in, and the magistrate, after using very abusive
language to Mr. Brownlow, had him sworn, but
would not let him tell his story. He flew into a
rage and told the policeman to tell what happened.</p>

<p>The policeman, with becoming humility, related
how he had taken the boy; how he had searched
Oliver, and found nothing on his person; and how
that was all he knew about it.</p>

<p>"Are there any witnesses?" inquired Mr. Fang.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>"None, your worship," replied the policeman.</p>

<p>Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then,
turning round to Mr. Brownlow, said in a towering
passion:</p>

<p>"Do you mean to state what your complaint
against this boy is, man, or do you not? You have
been sworn. Now, if you stand there, refusing
to give evidence, I'll punish you for disrespect to
the bench."</p>

<p>With many interruptions, and repeated insults,
Mr. Brownlow contrived to state his case; observing
that, in the surprise of the moment, he had run
after the boy because he saw him running away.</p>

<p>"He has been hurt already," said the old gentleman,
in conclusion. "And I fear," he added,
with great energy, looking toward the bar, "I
really fear that he is ill."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, I dare say!" said Mr. Fang, with a
sneer. "Come, none of your tricks here, you
young vagabond; they won't do. What's your
name?"</p>

<p>Oliver tried to reply, but his tongue failed him.
He was deadly pale; and the whole place seemed
turning round and round.</p>

<p>"What's your name, you hardened scoundrel?"
demanded Mr. Fang.</p>

<p>At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
head, and, looking round with imploring eyes,
asked feebly for a drink of water.</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" said Fang; "don't try to
make a fool of me."</p>

<p>"I think he really is ill, your worship," said the
officer.</p>

<p>"I know better," said Mr. Fang.</p>

<p>"Take care of him, officer," said the old gentleman,
raising his hands instinctively; "he'll fall
down."</p>

<p>"Stand away, officer," cried Fang; "let him, if
he likes."</p>

<p>Oliver availed himself of the kind permission,
and fell to the floor in a fainting fit. The men in
the office looked at each other, but no one dared to
stir.</p>

<p>"I knew he was shamming," said Fang, as if
this were enough proof of the fact. "Let him lie
there; he'll soon be tired of that."</p>

<p>"How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?"
inquired the clerk in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Summarily," replied Mr. Fang. "He stands
committed for three months&mdash;hard labor, of
course. Clear the office."</p>

<p>The door was opened for this purpose, and a
couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible
boy to his cell, when an elderly man of decent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black,
rushed in.</p>

<p>"Stop! stop! Don't take him away! For
heaven's sake stop a moment!" cried the newcomer,
breathless with haste.</p>

<p>"What is this? Who is this? Turn this man
out. Clear the office," cried Mr. Fang.</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> speak," cried the man; "I will not be
turned out. I saw it all. I keep the book-stall.
I demand to be sworn. I will not be put down.
Mr. Fang, you must hear me. You must not
refuse, sir."</p>

<p>The man was right. His manner was determined;
and the matter was growing rather too
serious to be hushed up.</p>

<p>"Swear the man," growled Mr. Fang, with a
very ill grace. "Now, man, what have you to
say?"</p>

<p>"This," said the man: "I saw three boys&mdash;two
two others and the prisoner here&mdash;loitering on the
opposite side of the way, when this gentleman
was reading. The robbery was committed by
another boy. I saw it done; and I saw this boy
was perfectly amazed and stupefied by it."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come here before?" said Fang,
after a pause.</p>

<p>"I hadn't a soul to mind the shop," replied the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
man. "Everybody who could have helped me
had joined in the pursuit. I could get nobody
till five minutes ago; and I have run here all the
way to speak the truth."</p>

<p>"The boy is discharged. Clear the office!"
shouted the angry magistrate.</p>

<p>The command was obeyed; and as Oliver was
taken out he fainted away again in the yard, and
lay with his face a deadly white and a cold tremble
convulsing his frame.</p>

<p>"Poor boy! poor boy!" said Mr. Brownlow,
bending over him. "Call a coach, somebody,
pray. Directly!"</p>

<p>A coach was obtained, and Oliver, having been
carefully laid on one seat, the old gentleman got
in and sat himself on the other.</p>

<p>"May I go with you?" said the book-stall keeper,
looking in.</p>

<p>"Bless me, yes, my dear sir," said Mr. Brownlow
quickly. "I forgot you. Dear, dear! I
have this unhappy book still! Jump in. Poor
fellow! No time to lose."</p>

<p>The book-stall keeper got into the coach, and it
rattled away. It stopped at length before a neat
house, in a quiet shady street. Here a bed was
prepared, without loss of time, in which Mr.
Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
comfortably laid; and here he was tended with a
kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds.</p>

<p>At last the sick boy began to recover, and one
day Mr. Brownlow came to see him. You may
imagine how happy Oliver was to see his good
friend; but he was no more delighted than was
Mr. Brownlow. The old gentleman came to
spend a short time with him every day; and, when
he grew stronger, Oliver went up to the learned
gentleman's study and talked with him by the
hour and was astonished at the books he saw, and
which Mr. Brownlow told him to look at and read
as much as he liked.</p>

<p>Oliver was soon well, and no thought was in
Mr. Brownlow's mind but that he should keep
him, and raise him and educate him to be a
splendid man; for no father loves his own son
better than Mr. Brownlow had come to love Oliver.</p>

<p>Now, I know, you want to ask me what became
of Oliver Twist. But I cannot tell you here.
Let us leave him in this beautiful home of good
Mr. Brownlow; and, if you want to read the rest
of his wonderful story, get Dickens' big book
called <i>Oliver Twist</i>, and read it there. There were
many surprises and much trouble yet in store for
Oliver, but he was always noble, honest, and
brave.</p>

<h3>EDWARD S. ELLIS</h3>


<p><b>Edward S. Ellis</b>, the popular writer of boys' books, is a
native of Ohio, where he was born somewhat more than a half-century
ago. His father was a famous hunter and rifle shot,
and it was doubtless his exploits and those of his associates,
with their tales of adventure which gave the son his taste
for the breezy backwoods and for depicting the stirring life
of the early settlers on the frontier.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis began writing at an early age and his work was
acceptable from the first. His parents removed to New
Jersey while he was a boy and he was graduated from the
State Normal School and became a member of the faculty
while still in his teens. He was afterward principal of the
Trenton High School, a trustee and then superintendent
of schools. By that time his services as a writer had become
so pronounced that he gave his entire attention to literature.
He was an exceptionally successful teacher and
wrote a number of text-books for schools, all of which met
with high favor. For these and his historical productions,
Princeton College conferred upon him the degree of Master
of Arts.</p>

<p>The high moral character, the clean, manly tendencies
and the admirable literary style of Mr. Ellis' stories have
made him as popular on the other side of the Atlantic as in
this country. A leading paper remarked some time since,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17ad" id="Page_17ad">[17]</a></span>
that no mother need hesitate to place in the hands of her
boy any book written by Mr. Ellis. They are found in
the leading Sunday-school libraries, where, as may well
be believed, they are in wide demand and do much good
by their sound, wholesome lessons which render them as
acceptable to parents as to their children. Nearly all of
the Ellis books published by The John C. Winston Company
are reissued in London, and many have been translated
into other languages. Mr. Ellis is a writer of varied accomplishments,
and, in addition to his stories, is the author of
historical works, of a number of pieces of popular music,
and has made several valuable inventions. Mr. Ellis is in
the prime of his mental and physical powers, and great as
have been the merits of his past achievements, there is
reason to look for more brilliant productions from his pen in
the near future.</p>
